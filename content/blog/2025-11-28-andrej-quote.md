[From @karpathy on X](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1993010584175141038):
> You will never be able to detect the use of AI in homework. ... You have to assume that any work done outside classroom has used AI. ... Therefore, the majority of grading has to shift to in-class work. Using the calculator as an example of a historically disruptive technology, school teaches you how to do all the basic math & arithmetic so that you can in principle do it by hand, even if calculators are pervasive and greatly speed up work in practical settings. In addition, you understand what it's doing for you, so should it give you a wrong answer (e.g. you mistyped "prompt"), you should be able to notice it, gut check it, verify it in some other way, etc. The verification ability is especially important in the case of AI, which is presently a lot more fallible in a great variety of ways compared to calculators.
