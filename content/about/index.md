I’m an Software Engineer dubbing as a prompt-to-product guy on a mission to bring all the weird stuff I cannot take off of my head into the real world, using GPU autocompletes to type for me or not. My mom has a simpler response: I work with computers at Google. 
Lately I’ve been busy automating my world (emails, parking permits, weekly groceries, you name it) and bookmarking more post-AGI articles than I can safely read on this organic form.
