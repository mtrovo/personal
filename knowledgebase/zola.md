Zola provides support for automatic image resizing through the built-in function `resize_image`,
which is available in template code as well as in shortcodes.

The function usage is as follows:

```jinja2
resize_image(path, width, height, op, format, quality)
```

### Arguments

- `path`: The path to the source image. The following directories will be searched, in this order:
    - `/` (the root of the project; that is, the directory with your `config.toml`)
    - `/static`
    - `/content`
    - `/public`
    - `/themes/current-theme/static`
- `width` and `height`: The dimensions in pixels of the resized image. Usage depends on the `op` argument.
- `op` (_optional_): Resize operation. This can be one of:
    - `"scale"`
    - `"fit_width"`
    - `"fit_height"`
    - `"fit"`
    - `"fill"`

  What each of these does is explained below. The default is `"fill"`.
- `format` (_optional_): Encoding format of the resized image. May be one of:
    - `"auto"`
    - `"jpg"`
    - `"png"`
    - `"webp"`
    - `"avif"`

  The default is `"auto"`, this means that the format is chosen based on input image format.
  JPEG is chosen for JPEGs and other lossy formats, and PNG is chosen for PNGs and other lossless formats.
- `quality` (_optional_): Quality of the resized image, in percent. Only used when encoding JPEGs, WebPs or AVIFs; for JPEG default value is `75`, for WebP default is lossless, for Avif default is `70`.

### Image processing and return value

Zola performs image processing during the build process and places the resized images in a subdirectory in the static files directory:

```
static/processed_images/
```

The filename of each resized image is a hash of the function arguments,
which means that once an image is resized in a certain way, it will be stored in the above directory and will not
need to be resized again during subsequent builds (unless the image itself, the dimensions, or other arguments have changed).

The function returns an object with the following schema:

```
/// The final URL for that asset
url: String,
/// The path to the static asset generated
static_path: String,
/// New image width
width: u32,
/// New image height
height: u32,
/// Original image width
orig_width: u32,
/// Original image height
orig_height: u32,
```

## Resize operations

The source for all examples is this 300 pixel × 380 pixel image:

![zola](01-zola.png)

### **`"scale"`**
  Simply scales the image to the specified dimensions (`width` & `height`) irrespective of the aspect ratio.

  `resize_image(..., width=150, height=150, op="scale")`

  {{ resize_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", width=150, height=150, op="scale") }}

### **`"fit_width"`**
  Resizes the image such that the resulting width is `width` and height is whatever will preserve the aspect ratio.
  The `height` argument is not needed.

  `resize_image(..., width=100, op="fit_width")`

  {{ resize_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", width=100, height=0, op="fit_width") }}

### **`"fit_height"`**
  Resizes the image such that the resulting height is `height` and width is whatever will preserve the aspect ratio.
  The `width` argument is not needed.

  `resize_image(..., height=150, op="fit_height")`

  {{ resize_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", width=0, height=150, op="fit_height") }}

### **`"fit"`**
  Like `"fit_width"` and `"fit_height"` combined, but only resize if the image is bigger than any of the specified dimensions.
  This mode is handy, if for example images are automatically shrunk to certain sizes in a shortcode for
  mobile optimization.
  Resizes the image such that the result fits within `width` and `height` while preserving the aspect ratio. This
  means that both width or height will be at max `width` and `height`, respectively, but possibly one of them
  smaller so as to preserve the aspect ratio.


  `resize_image(..., width=5000, height=5000, op="fit")`

  {{ resize_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", width=5000, height=5000, op="fit") }}

  `resize_image(..., width=150, height=150, op="fit")`

  {{ resize_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", width=150, height=150, op="fit") }}

### **`"fill"`**
  This is the default operation. It takes the image's center part with the same aspect ratio as the `width` and
  `height` given and resizes that to `width` and `height`. This means that parts of the image that are outside
  of the resized aspect ratio are cropped away.

  `resize_image(..., width=150, height=150, op="fill")`

  {{ resize_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", width=150, height=150, op="fill") }}


## Using `resize_image` in markdown via shortcodes

`resize_image` is a Zola built-in Tera function (see the [templates](@/documentation/templates/_index.md) chapter),
but it can be used in Markdown using [shortcodes](@/documentation/content/shortcodes.md).

The examples above were generated using a shortcode file named `resize_image.html` with this content:

```jinja2
{% set image = resize_image(path=path, width=width, height=height, op=op) %}
<img src="{{ image.url }}" />
```

## Creating picture galleries

The `resize_image()` can be used multiple times and/or in loops. It is designed to handle this efficiently.

This can be used along with `assets` [page metadata](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md) to create picture galleries.
The `assets` variable holds paths to all assets in the directory of a page with resources
(see [asset colocation](@/documentation/content/overview.md#asset-colocation)); if you have files other than images you
will need to filter them out in the loop first like in the example below.

This can be used in shortcodes. For example, we can create a very simple html-only clickable
picture gallery with the following shortcode named `gallery.html`:

```jinja2
<div>
{% for asset in page.assets -%}
  {%- if asset is matching("[.](jpg|png)$") -%}
    {% set image = resize_image(path=asset, width=240, height=180) %}
    <a href="{{ get_url(path=asset) }}" target="_blank">
      <img src="{{ image.url }}" />
    </a>
  {%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
</div>
```

As you can notice, we didn't specify an `op` argument, which means that it'll default to `"fill"`. Similarly,
the format will default to `"auto"` (choosing PNG or JPEG as appropriate) and the JPEG quality will default to `75`.

To call it from a Markdown file, simply do:

```jinja2
{{/* gallery() */}}
```

Here is the result:

{{ gallery() }}

## Get image size and relative resizing

Sometimes when building a gallery it is useful to know the dimensions of each asset.  You can get this information with
[get_image_metadata](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#get-image-metadata).

This can also be useful in combination with `resize_image()` to do a relative resizing. So we can create a relative image resizing function with the following shortcode named `resize_image_relative.html`:

```jinja2
{% set mdata = get_image_metadata(path=path) %}
{% set image = resize_image(path=path, width=(mdata.width * scale)|int, op="fit_width") %}
<img src="{{ image.url }}" />
```

It can be invoked from Markdown like this:

`resize_image_relative(..., scale=0.5)`

{{ resize_image_relative(path="documentation/content/image-processing/01-zola.png", scale=0.5) }}

## Creating scaled-down versions of high-resolution images

With the above, we can also create a shortcode that creates a 50% scaled-down version of a high-resolution image (e.g. screenshots taken on Retina Macs), along with the proper HTML5 `srcset` for the original image to be displayed on high-resolution / retina displays.

Consider the following shortcode named `high_res_image.html`:

```jinja2
{% set mdata = get_image_metadata(path=path) %}
{% set w = (mdata.width / 2) | int %}
{% set h = (mdata.height / 2) | int %}
{% set image = resize_image(path=path, width=w, height=h, op="fit_width") %}
<img src="{{ image.url }}" srcset="/{{path}} 2x"/>
```

{{ high_res_image(path="documentation/content/image-processing/08-example.jpg") }}

## Heading id and anchor insertion
While rendering the Markdown content, a unique id will automatically be assigned to each heading. 
This id is created by converting the heading text to a [slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug) if `slugify.anchors` is set to `"on"` (the default).
If `slugify.paths` is set to `"safe"`, whitespaces are replaced by `-` and the following characters are stripped: `#`, `%`, `<`, `>`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, \`, `^`, `{`, `|`, `}`.
If `slugify.paths` is set to `"off"`, no modifications are made, and you may be left with nominally illegal ids.
A number is appended at the end if the slug already exists for that article.
For example:

```md
# Something exciting! <- something-exciting
## Example code <- example-code

# Something else <- something-else
## Example code <- example-code-1
```

You can also manually specify an id with a `{#…}` suffix on the heading line as well as CSS classes:

```md
# Something manual! {#manual .header .bold}
```

This is useful for making deep links robust, either proactively (so that you can later change the text of a heading
without breaking links to it) or retroactively (keeping the slug of the old header text when changing the text). It
can also be useful for migration of existing sites with different header id schemes, so that you can keep deep
links working.

## Anchor insertion
It is possible to have Zola automatically insert anchor links next to the heading, as you can see on this documentation
if you hover a title or covering the full heading text.

This option is set in the global [`config.toml`](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md)'s `[markdown]` section and can be overridden at the section level with the `insert_anchor_links` variable on the
[section front matter page](@/documentation/content/section.md#front-matter).

The default template is very basic and will need CSS tweaks in your project to look decent.
If you want to change the anchor template, it can be easily overwritten by
creating an `anchor-link.html` file in the `templates` directory. [Here](https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/master/components/templates/src/builtins/anchor-link.html) you can find the default template.

The anchor link template has the following variables:

- `id`: the heading's id after applying the rules defined by `slugify.anchors`
- `lang`: the current language, unless called from the `markdown` template filter, in which case it will always be `en`
- `level`: the heading level (between 1 and 6)

If you use `insert_anchor = "heading"`, the template will still be used but only the opening `<a>` tag will get extracted
from it, everything else will not be used.

## Internal links
Linking to other pages and their headings is so common that Zola adds a
special syntax to Markdown links to handle them: start the link with `@/` and point to the `.md` file you want
to link to. The path to the file starts from the `content` directory.

For example, linking to a file located at `content/pages/about.md` would be `[my link](@/pages/about.md)`.
You can still link to an anchor directly; `[my link](@/pages/about.md#example)` will work as expected.

By default, broken internal links are treated as errors.  To treat them as warnings instead, visit the `[link_checker]` section of `config.toml` and set `internal_level = "warn"`.  Note: treating broken links as warnings allows the site to be built with broken links intact, so a link such as `[my link](@/pages/whoops.md)` will be rendered to HTML as `<a href="@/pages/whoops.md">`.

Zola supports having a site in multiple languages.

## Configuration
To get started, you will need to add the languages you want to support
to your `config.toml`. For example:

```toml
[languages.fr]
generate_feeds = true # there will be a feed for French content
build_search_index = true
taxonomies = [
    {name = "auteurs"},
    {name = "tags"},
]

[languages.fr.translations]
summary = "Mon blog"

[languages.it]
# Italian language doesn't have any taxonomies/feed/search index

[languages.it.translations]
summary = "Mio blog"

# translations for the default language are not prefixed by languages.code
[translations]
summary = "My blog"
```

Note: By default, Chinese and Japanese search indexing is not included. You can include
the support by building `zola` using `cargo build --features indexing-ja --features indexing-zh`.
Please also note that, enabling Chinese indexing will increase the binary size by approximately
5 MB while enabling Japanese indexing will increase the binary size by approximately 70 MB
due to the incredibly large dictionaries.

## Content
Once the languages have been added, you can start to translate your content. Zola
uses the filename to detect the language:

- `content/an-article.md`: this will be the default language
- `content/an-article.fr.md`: this will be in French

If the language code in the filename does not correspond to one of the languages or
the default language configured, an error will be shown.

If your default language has an `_index.md` in a directory, you will need to add an `_index.{code}.md`
file with the desired front-matter options as there is no language fallback.

## Output
Zola outputs the translated content with a base URL of `{base_url}/{code}/`.
The only exception to this is if you are setting a translated page `path` directly in the front matter.

Zola uses the directory structure to determine the site structure.
Each child directory in the `content` directory represents a [section](@/documentation/content/section.md)
that contains [pages](@/documentation/content/page.md) (your `.md` files).

```bash
.
└── content
    ├── content
    │   └── something.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/content/something/
    ├── blog
    │   ├── cli-usage.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/cli-usage/

    │   └── installation.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/installation/
    └── landing
        └── _index.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/landing/
```

Each page path (the part after `base_url`, for example `blog/cli-usage/`) can be customised by changing the `path` or
`slug` attribute of the [page front-matter](@/documentation/content/page.md#front-matter).

You might have noticed a file named `_index.md` in the example above.
This file is used to store both the metadata and content of the section itself and is not considered a page.

To ensure that the terminology used in the rest of the documentation is understood, let's go over the example above.

The `content` directory in this case has three `sections`: `content`, `blog` and `landing`. The `content` section has only
one page (`something.md`), the `landing` section has no pages and the `blog` section has 4 pages (`cli-usage.md`,
`configuration.md`, `directory-structure.md` and `installation.md`).

Sections can be nested indefinitely.

## Asset colocation

The `content` directory is not limited to markup files. It's natural to want to co-locate a page and some related
assets, such as images or spreadsheets. Zola supports this pattern out of the box for both sections and pages.

All non-Markdown files you add in a page/section directory will be copied alongside the generated page when the site is
built, which allows us to use a relative path to access them.

Pages with co-located assets should not be placed directly in their section directory (such as `latest-experiment.md`), but
as an `index.md` file in a dedicated directory (`latest-experiment/index.md`), like so:


```bash
└── research
    ├── latest-experiment
    │   ├── index.md
    │   └── javascript.js
    ├── _index.md
    └── research.jpg
```

With this setup, you may access `research.jpg` from your 'research' section
and `javascript.js` from your 'latest-experiment' page directly within the Markdown:

```Markdown
Check out the complete program [here](javascript.js). It's **really cool free-software**!
```

By default, this page's slug will be the directory name and thus its permalink will be `https://example.com/research/latest-experiment/`.

### Excluding files from assets

It is possible to ignore selected asset files using the
[ignored_content](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md) setting in the config file.
For example, say that you have several code files which you are linking to on your website.
For maintainability, you want to keep your code in the same directory as the Markdown file,
but you don't want to copy the build folders to the public web site. You can achieve this by setting `ignored_content` in the config file:

(Note of caution: `{Cargo.lock,target}` is _not_ the same as `{Cargo.lock, target}`)
```
ignored_content = ["code_articles/**/{Cargo.lock,target}, *.rs"]
```

## Static assets

In addition to placing content files in the `content` directory, you may also place content
files in the `static` directory.  Any files/directories that you place in the `static` directory
will be copied, without modification, to the `public` directory.

Typically, you might put site-wide assets (such as a CSS file, the site favicon, site logos or site-wide
JavaScript) in the root of the static directory. You can also place any HTML or other files that
you wish to be included without modification (that is, without being parsed as Markdown files)
into the static directory.

Note that the static directory provides an _alternative_ to co-location.  For example, imagine that you
had the following directory structure (a simplified version of the structure presented above):

```bash
.
└── content
    └── blog
        ├── configuration
        │    └── index.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/configuration/
        └── _index.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/
```

To add an image to the `https://mywebsite.com/blog/configuration` page, you have three options:
 *  You could save the image to the `content/blog/configuration` directory and then link to it with a
 relative path from the `index.md` page.  This is the approach described under **co-location**
 above.
 *  You could save the image to a `static/blog/configuration` directory and link to it in exactly the
 same way as if you had co-located it. If you do this, the generated files will be identical to those
 obtained if you had co-located the image; the only difference will be that all static files will be saved in the
 static directory rather than in the content directory. The choice depends on your organizational needs.
 *  Or you could save the image to some arbitrary directory within the static directory. For example,
 you could save all images to `static/images`.  Using this approach, you can no longer use relative links. Instead,
 you must use an absolute link to `images/[filename]` to access your
 image. This might be preferable for small sites or for sites that associate images with
 multiple pages (e.g., logo images that appear on every page).

File: docs/content/documentation/content/page.md
================
+++
title = "Page"
weight = 30
+++

A page is any file ending with `.md` in the `content` directory, except files
named `_index.md`. **Note:** page file names must not contain `_index.` [at all](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pull/1694).

If a file ending with `.md` is named `index.md`, it will generate a page
with the name of its directory (for example, `/content/about/index.md` would
create a page at `[base_url]/about`). (Note the lack of an underscore; if the file
were named `_index.md`, then it would create a **section** at `[base_url]/about`, as
discussed in a previous part of this documentation. In contrast, naming the file `index.md` will
create a **page** at `[base_url]/about`).

If the file is given any name _other_ than `index.md` or `_index.md`, then it will
create a page with that name (without the `.md`). For example, naming a file in the root of your
content directory `about.md` would create a page at `[base_url]/about`.

Another exception to this rule is that a filename starting with a datetime (YYYY-mm-dd or [an RFC3339 datetime](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)) followed by
an underscore (`_`) or a dash (`-`) will use that date as the page date, unless already set
in the front matter. The page name will be anything after `_`/`-`, so the file `2018-10-10-hello-world.md` will
be available at `[base_url]/hello-world`. Note that the full RFC3339 datetime contains colons, which is not a valid
character in a filename on Windows.
This behavior can be disabled by setting `slugify.paths_keep_dates` to `true` (the default is `false`). Note that a `_` separating the date would be slugified into a `-` with the default value for `slugify.paths` of `"on"`.

As you can see, creating an `about.md` file is equivalent to creating an
`about/index.md` file. The only difference between the two methods is that creating
the `about` directory allows you to use asset co-location, as discussed in the
[overview](@/documentation/content/overview.md#asset-colocation) section.

## Output paths

For any page within your content folder, its output path will be defined by either:

- its `slug` frontmatter key
- its filename

Either way, these proposed path will be sanitized before being used.
If `slugify.paths` is set to `"on"` in the site's config - the default - paths are [slugified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug).
If it is set to `"safe"`, only sanitation is performed, with the following characters being removed: `<`, `>`, `:`, `/`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `#`, `\\`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]` as well as newlines and tabulations. This ensures that the path can be represented on all operating systems.
Additionally, trailing whitespace and dots are removed and whitespaces are replaced by `_`.

If `slugify.paths` is set to `"off"`, no modifications are made.

If you want URLs containing non-ASCII characters, `slugify.paths` needs to be set to `"safe"` or `"off"`.

### Path from frontmatter

The output path for the page will first be read from the `slug` key in the page's frontmatter.

**Example:** (file `content/zines/élevage-chèvre.md`)

```
+++
title = "L'élevage de chèvres, la carrière alternative de tous dévelopeurs'"
slug = "élevage-chèvre-carrière-alternative"
+++
This is my article.
```

This frontmatter will output the article to `[base_url]/zines/élevage-chèvre-carrière-alternative` with `slugify.paths` set to `"safe"` or `"off"`, and to `[base_url]/zines/elevage-chevre-carriere-alternative` with the default value for `slugify.paths` of `"on"`.

### Path from filename

When the article's output path is not specified in the frontmatter, it is extracted from the file's path in the content folder. Consider a file `content/foo/bar/thing.md`. The output path is constructed:

- if the filename is `index.md`, its parent folder name (`bar`) is used as output path
- otherwise, the output path is extracted from `thing` (the filename without the `.md` extension)

If the path found starts with a datetime string (`YYYY-mm-dd` or [a RFC3339 datetime](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)) followed by optional whitespace and then an underscore (`_`) or a dash (`-`), this date is removed from the output path and will be used as the page date (unless already set in the front-matter). Note that the full RFC3339 datetime contains colons, which is not a valid character in a filename on Windows.

The output path extracted from the file path is then slugified or not, depending on the `slugify.paths` config, as explained previously.

**Example:**
The file `content/blog/2018-10-10-hello-world.md` will yield a page at `[base_url]/blog/hello-world`. With optional whitespace, the file `content/blog/2021-01-23 -hello new world.md` will yield a page at `[base_url]/blog/hello-new-world`

## Front matter

The TOML front matter is a set of metadata embedded in a file at the beginning of the file enclosed
by triple pluses (`+++`).

Although none of the front matter variables are mandatory, the opening and closing `+++` are required.

Note that even though the use of TOML is encouraged, YAML front matter is also supported to ease porting
legacy content. In this case the embedded metadata must be enclosed by triple minuses (`---`).

Here is an example page with all the available variables. The values provided below are the
default values.

```toml
title = ""
description = ""

# The date of the post.
# Two formats are allowed: YYYY-MM-DD (2012-10-02) and RFC3339 (2002-10-02T15:00:00Z).
# Do not wrap dates in quotes; the line below only indicates that there is no default date.
# If the section variable `sort_by` is set to `date`, then any page that lacks a `date`
# will not be rendered.
# Setting this overrides a date set in the filename.
date =

# The last updated date of the post, if different from the date.
# Same format as `date`.
updated =

# The weight as defined on the Section page of the documentation.
# If the section variable `sort_by` is set to `weight`, then any page that lacks a `weight`
# will not be rendered.
weight = 0

# A draft page is only loaded if the `--drafts` flag is passed to `zola build`, `zola serve` or `zola check`.
draft = false

# When set to "false" Zola will not create a separate folder with index.html inside for this page.
render = false

# If set, this slug will be used instead of the filename to make the URL.
# The section path will still be used.
slug = ""

# The path the content will appear at.
# If set, it cannot be an empty string and will override both `slug` and the filename.
# The sections' path won't be used.
# It should not start with a `/` and the slash will be removed if it does.
path = ""

# Use aliases if you are moving content but want to redirect previous URLs to the
# current one. This takes an array of paths, not URLs.
aliases = []

# A list of page authors. If a site feed is enabled, the first author (if any)
# will be used as the page's author in the default feed template.
authors = []

# When set to "true", the page will be in the search index. This is only used if
# `build_search_index` is set to "true" in the Zola configuration and the parent section
# hasn't set `in_search_index` to "false" in its front matter.
in_search_index = true

# Template to use to render this page.
template = "page.html"

# The taxonomies for this page. The keys need to be the same as the taxonomy
# names configured in `config.toml` and the values are an array of String objects. For example,
# tags = ["rust", "web"].
[taxonomies]

# Your own data.
[extra]
```

## Summary

You can ask Zola to create a summary if, for example, you only want to show the first
paragraph of the page content in a list.

To do so, add `<!-- more -->` in your content at the point
where you want the summary to end. The content up to that point will be
available separately in the
[template](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md#page-variables) via `page.summary`.

A span element in this position with a `continue-reading` id is created, so you can link directly to it if needed. For example:
`<a href="{{ page.permalink }}#continue-reading">Continue Reading</a>`.

The `<!-- more -->` marker can also exist in the middle of a line, and it will ensure that this does not emit unclosed HTML tags.
You can use the `summary-cutoff.html` to show text after the summary (but before these closing tags) based
upon the summary before the cutoff.

By default, it will show an ellipsis (…) regardless of the content of the summary, but you can use a different template if you want to only show an ellipsis if the summary does not end in any punctuation:

```jinja
{% if summary is matching("\PP$") %}&hellip;{% endif %}
```

Sass is a popular CSS preprocessor that adds special features (e.g., variables, nested rules) to facilitate the
maintenance of large sets of CSS rules. If you're curious about what Sass
is and why it might be useful for styling your static site, the following links
may be of interest:

* The [official Sass website](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Why Sass?](https://alistapart.com/article/why-sass), by Dan Cederholm

It currently uses [grass](https://github.com/connorskees/grass), a Rust implementation of Sass roughly equivalent
with dart-sass.

## Using Sass in Zola

Zola always compiles Sass files in theme directories.
However, for Zola to process files in the `sass` folder, you need to set `compile_sass = true` in your `config.toml`.

Zola processes any files with the `sass` or `scss` extension in the `sass`
folder, and places the processed output into a `css` file with the same folder
structure and base name into the `public` folder:

```bash
.
└── sass
    ├── style.scss // -> ./public/style.css
    ├── indented_style.sass // -> ./public/indented_style.css
    ├── _include.scss # This file won't get put into the `public` folder, but other files can @import it.
    ├── assets
    │   ├── fancy.scss // -> ./public/assets/fancy.css
    │   ├── same_name.scss // -> ./public/assets/same_name.css
    │   ├── same_name.sass # CONFLICT! This has the same base name as the file above, so Zola will return an error.
    │   └── _common_mixins.scss # This file won't get put into the `public` folder, but other files can @import it.
    └── secret-side-project
        └── style.scss // -> ./public/secret-side-project/style.css
```

Files with a leading underscore in the name are not placed into the `public`
folder, but can still be used as `@import` dependencies. For more information, see the "Partials" section of
[Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide).

Files with the `scss` extension use "Sassy CSS" syntax,
while files with the `sass` extension use the "indented" syntax: <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax>.
Zola will return an error if `scss` and `sass` files with the same
base name exist in the same folder to avoid confusion -- see the example above.

================
File: docs/content/documentation/content/search.md
================
+++
title = "Search"
weight = 100
+++

Zola can build a search index from the sections and pages content to
be used by a JavaScript library such as [elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) or [fuse](https://www.fusejs.io).

To enable it, you only need to set `build_search_index = true` in your `config.toml` and Zola will
generate an index for the `default_language` set for all pages not excluded from the search index.

It is very important to set the `default_language` in your `config.toml` if you are writing a site not in
English; the index building pipelines are very different depending on the language.

As each site will be different, Zola makes no assumptions about your search function and doesn't provide
the JavaScript/CSS code to do an actual search and display results. You can look at how this site
implements it (using elasticlunr) to get an idea: [search.js](https://github.com/getzola/zola/tree/master/docs/static/search.js).


## Configuring the search index
In some cases, the default indexing strategy is not suitable. You can customize which fields to include and whether
to truncate the content in the [search configuration](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md).

## Index Formats

### Elasticlunr

Compatible with [elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Also produces `elasticlunr.min.js`.

```toml
# config.toml
[search]
index_format = "elasticlunr_javascript" # or "elasticlunr_json"
```

If you are using a language other than English, you will also need to include the corresponding JavaScript stemmer file.
See <https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages#in-a-web-browser> for details.

### Fuse

Compatible with [fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) and [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch).

```toml
# config.toml
[search]
index_format = "fuse_javascript" # or "fuse_json"
```

================
File: docs/content/documentation/content/section.md
================
+++
title = "Section"
weight = 20
+++

A section is created whenever a directory (or subdirectory) in the `content` section contains an
`_index.md` file.  If a directory does not contain an `_index.md` file, no section will be
created, but Markdown files within that directory will still create pages (known as orphan pages).

The homepage (i.e., the page displayed when a user browses to your `base_url`) is a section,
which is created whether or not you add an `_index.md` file at the root of your `content` directory.
If you do not create an `_index.md` file in your content directory, this main content section will
not have any content or metadata.  If you would like to add content or metadata, you can add an
`_index.md` file at the root of the `content` directory and edit it just as you would edit any other
`_index.md` file; your `index.html` template will then have access to that content and metadata.

Any non-Markdown file in a section directory is added to the `assets` collection of the section, as explained in the
[content overview](@/documentation/content/overview.md#asset-colocation). These files are then available in the
Markdown file using relative links.

## Drafting
Just like pages sections can be drafted by setting the `draft` option in the front matter. By default this is not done. When a section is drafted it's descendants like pages, subsections and assets will not be processed unless the `--drafts` flag is passed. Note that even pages that don't have a `draft` status will not be processed if one of their parent sections is drafted.

## Front matter

The `_index.md` file within a directory defines the content and metadata for that section.  To set
the metadata, add front matter to the file.

The TOML front matter is a set of metadata embedded in a file at the beginning of the file enclosed by triple pluses (`+++`).

After the closing `+++`, you can add content, which will be parsed as Markdown and made available
to your templates through the `section.content` variable.

Although none of the front matter variables are mandatory, the opening and closing `+++` are required.

Note that even though the use of TOML is encouraged, YAML front matter is also supported to ease porting
legacy content. In this case the embedded metadata must be enclosed by triple minuses (`---`).

Here is an example `_index.md` with all the available variables. The values provided below are the
default values.


```toml
title = ""

description = ""

# A draft section is only loaded if the `--drafts` flag is passed to `zola build`, `zola serve` or `zola check`.
draft = false

# Used to sort pages by "date", "update_date", "title", "title_bytes", "weight", "slug" or "none". See below for more information.
sort_by = "none"

# Used by the parent section to order its subsections.
# Lower values have higher priority.
weight = 0

# Template to use to render this section page.
template = "section.html"

# The given template is applied to ALL pages below the section, recursively.
# If you have several nested sections, each with a page_template set, the page
# will always use the closest to itself.
# However, a page's own `template` variable will always have priority.
# Not set by default.
page_template =

# This sets the number of pages to be displayed per paginated page.
# No pagination will happen if this isn't set or if the value is 0.
paginate_by = 0

# If set, this will be the path used by the paginated page. The page number will be appended after this path.
# The default is page/1.
paginate_path = "page"

# If set, there will pagination will happen in a reversed order.
paginate_reversed = false

# This determines whether to insert a link for each header like the ones you can see on this site if you hover over
# a header.
# The default template can be overridden by creating an `anchor-link.html` file in the `templates` directory.
# This value can be "left", "right", "heading" or "none".
# "heading" means the full heading becomes the text of the anchor.
insert_anchor_links = "none"

# If set to "true", the section pages will be in the search index. This is only used if
# `build_search_index` is set to "true" in the Zola configuration file.
in_search_index = true

# If set to "true", the section homepage is rendered.
# Useful when the section is used to organize pages (not used directly).
render = true

# This determines whether to redirect when a user lands on the section. Defaults to not being set.
# Useful for the same reason as `render` but when you don't want a 404 when
# landing on the root section page.
# Example: redirect_to = "documentation/content/overview"
redirect_to =

# If set to "true", the section will pass its pages on to the parent section. Defaults to `false`.
# Useful when the section shouldn't split up the parent section, like
# sections for each year under a posts section.
transparent = false

# Use aliases if you are moving content but want to redirect previous URLs to the
# current one. This takes an array of paths, not URLs.
aliases = []

# If set to "true", feed files will be generated for this section at the
# section's root path. This is independent of the site-wide variable of the same
# name. The section feed will only include posts from that respective feed, and
# not from any other sections, including sub-sections under that section.
generate_feeds = false

# Your own data.
[extra]
```

Keep in mind that any configuration options apply only to the direct pages, not to the subsections' pages.

## Pagination

To enable pagination for a section's pages, set `paginate_by` to a positive number. See
[pagination template documentation](@/documentation/templates/pagination.md) for more information
on what variables are available in the template.

You can also change the pagination path (the word displayed while paginated in the URL, like `page/1`)
by setting the `paginate_path` variable, which defaults to `page`.

## Sorting

It is very common for Zola templates to iterate over pages or sections
to display all pages/sections in a given directory.  Consider a very simple
example: a `blog` directory with three files: `blog/Post_1.md`,
`blog/Post_2.md` and `blog/Post_3.md`.  To iterate over these posts and
create a list of links to the posts, a simple template might look like this:

```j2
{% for post in section.pages %}
  <h1><a href="{{ post.permalink }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>
{% endfor %}
```

This would iterate over the posts in the order specified
by the `sort_by` variable set in the `_index.md` page for the corresponding
section.  The `sort_by` variable can be given a few values: `date`, `update_date`
`title`, `title_bytes`, `weight`, `slug` or `none`.  If `sort_by` is not set, the pages will be
sorted in the `none` order, which is not intended for sorted content.

Any page that is missing the data it needs to be sorted will be ignored and
won't be rendered. For example, if a page is missing the date variable and its
section sets `sort_by = "date"`, then that page will be ignored.
The terminal will warn you if this occurs.

If several pages have the same date/weight/order, their permalink will be used
to break the tie based on alphabetical order.

## Sorting pages
The `sort_by` front-matter variable can have the following values:

### `date`
This will sort all pages by their `date` field, from the most recent (at the
top of the list) to the oldest (at the bottom of the list). Each page will
get `page.lower` and `page.higher` variables that contain the pages with
earlier and later dates, respectively.

### `update_date`
Same as `date` except it will take into account any `updated` date for the pages.

### `title`
This will sort all pages by their `title` field in natural lexical order, as
defined  by `natural_lexical_cmp` in the [lexical-sort] crate. Each page will
get `page.lower` and `page.higher` variables that contain the pages
with  previous and next titles, respectively.

For example, here is a natural lexical ordering: "bachata, BART, bolero,
μ-kernel, meter, Métro, Track-2, Track-3, Track-13, underground". Notice how
special characters and numbers are sorted reasonably.

[lexical-sort]: https://docs.rs/lexical-sort

### `title_bytes`
Same as `title` except it uses the bytes directly to sort.
Natural sorting treats non-ascii
characters like their closest ascii character. This can lead to unexpected
results for languages with different character sets. The last three characters
of the Swedish alphabet, åäö, for example would be considered by the natural
sort as aao. In that case the standard byte-order sort may be more suitable.

### `weight`
This will sort all pages by their `weight` field, from the lightest weight
(at the top of the list) to the heaviest (at the bottom of the list). Each
page gets `page.lower` and `page.higher` variables that contain the
pages with lighter and heavier weights, respectively.

### `slug`
This will sort pages or sections by their slug in natural lexical order.

### Reversed sorting
When iterating through pages, you may wish to use the Tera `reverse` filter,
which reverses the order of the pages.  For example, after using the `reverse` filter,
pages sorted by weight will be sorted from lightest (at the top) to heaviest
(at the bottom); pages sorted by date will be sorted from oldest (at the top)
to newest (at the bottom).

`reverse` has no effect on `page.lower` / `page.higher`.

If the section is paginated the `paginate_reversed=true` in the front matter of the relevant section should be set instead of using the filter.

## Sorting subsections
Sorting sections is a bit less flexible: sections can only be sorted by `weight`,
and do not have variables that point to the heavier/lighter sections.

By default, the lightest (lowest `weight`) subsections will be at
the top of the list and the heaviest (highest `weight`) will be at the bottom;
the `reverse` filter reverses this order.

**Note**: Unlike pages, permalinks will **not** be used to break ties between
equally weighted sections. Thus, if the `weight` variable for your section is not set (or if it
is set in a way that produces ties), then your sections will be sorted in
**random** order. Moreover, that order is determined at build time and will
change with each site rebuild.  Thus, if there is any chance that you will
iterate over your sections, you should always assign them distinct weights.

In our case, a shortcode corresponds to a template defined in the `templates/shortcodes` directory that can be used in a Markdown file.

Broadly speaking, Zola's shortcodes cover two distinct use cases:

* Inject more complex HTML: Markdown is good for writing, but it isn't great when you need to add inline HTML or styling.
* Ease repetitive data based tasks: when you have [external data](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#load-data) that you
  want to display in your page's body.

The latter may also be solved by writing HTML, however Zola allows the use of Markdown based shortcodes which end in `.md`
rather than `.html`. This may be particularly useful if you want to include headings generated by the shortcode in the
[table of contents](@/documentation/content/table-of-contents.md).

If you want to use something similar to shortcodes in your templates, you can use [Tera macros](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs#macros). They are functions or components that you can call to return some text.

## Writing a shortcode
Let's write a shortcode to embed YouTube videos as an example.
In a file called `youtube.html` in the `templates/shortcodes` directory, paste the
following:

```jinja2
<div {% if class %}class="{{class}}"{% endif %}>
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{{id}}{% if autoplay %}?autoplay=1{% endif %}"
        webkitallowfullscreen
        mozallowfullscreen
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>
```

This template is very straightforward: an iframe pointing to the YouTube embed URL wrapped in a `<div>`.
In terms of input, this shortcode expects at least one variable: `id` ([example here](#shortcodes-without-body)).
Because the other variables are in an `if` statement, they are optional.

That's it. Zola will now recognise this template as a shortcode named `youtube` (the filename minus the `.html` extension).

The Markdown renderer will wrap an inline HTML node such as `<a>` or `<span>` into a paragraph.
If you want to disable this behaviour, wrap your shortcode in a `<div>`.

A Markdown based shortcode in turn will be treated as if what it returned was part of the page's body. If we create
`books.md` in `templates/shortcodes` for example:

```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(path=path) -%}
{% for book in data.books %}
### {{ book.title }}

{{ book.description | safe }}
{% endfor %}
```

This will create a shortcode `books` with the argument `path` pointing to a `.toml` file where it loads lists of books with
titles and descriptions. They will flow with the rest of the document in which `books` is called.

Shortcodes are rendered before the page's Markdown is parsed so they don't have access to the page's table of contents.
Because of that, you also cannot use the [`get_page`](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#get-page) / [`get_section`](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#get-section) / [`get_taxonomy`](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#get-taxonomy) / [`get_taxonomy_term`](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#get-taxonomy-term) global functions. It might work while
running `zola serve` because it has been loaded but it will fail during `zola build`.

## Using shortcodes

There are two kinds of shortcodes:

- ones that do not take a body, such as the YouTube example above
- ones that do, such as one that styles a quote

In both cases, the arguments must be named and they will all be passed to the template. 
Parentheses are mandatory even if there are no arguments.

Note that while shortcodes look like normal Tera expressions, they are not Tera at all -- they can
pretty much just shuttle arguments to their template. Several limitations of note are:

- All arguments are required
- The shortcode cannot reference Tera variables
- Concatenation and other operators are unavailable

If the shortcode is invalid, it will not be interpreted by the markdown parser and will instead
get rendered directly into the final HTML.

Lastly, a shortcode name (and thus the corresponding `.html` file) as well as any argument names
can only contain numbers, letters and underscores, and must start with a letter or underscore.
In Regex terms, `^[A-Za-z_][0-9A-Za-z_]+$`.

Argument values can be of one of five types:

- string: surrounded by double quotes, single quotes or backticks
- bool: `true` or `false`
- float: a number with a decimal point (e.g., 1.2)
- integer: a whole number or its negative counterpart (e.g., 3)
- array: an array of any kind of value, except arrays

Malformed values will be silently ignored.

Both types of shortcode will also get either a `page` or `section` variable depending on where they were used
and a `config` variable. These values will overwrite any arguments passed to a shortcode so these variable names
should not be used as argument names in shortcodes.

### Shortcodes without body

Simply call the shortcode as if it was a Tera function in a variable block.

```md
Here is a YouTube video:

{{/* youtube(id="dQw4w9WgXcQ") */}}

{{/* youtube(id="dQw4w9WgXcQ", autoplay=true) */}}

An inline {{/* youtube(id="dQw4w9WgXcQ", autoplay=true, class="youtube") */}} shortcode
```

Note that if you want to have some content that looks like a shortcode but not have Zola try to render it,
you will need to escape it by using `{{/*` and `*/}}` instead of `{{` and `}}`.

### Shortcodes with body
Let's imagine that we have the following shortcode `quote.html` template:

```jinja2
<blockquote>
    {{ body }} <br>
    -- {{ author}}
</blockquote>
```

We could use it in our Markdown file like so:

```md
As someone said:

{%/* quote(author="Vincent") */%}
A quote
{%/* end */%}
```

The body of the shortcode will be automatically passed down to the rendering context as the `body` variable and needs
to be on a new line.

### Shortcodes with no arguments
Note that for both cases that the parentheses for shortcodes are necessary. 
A shortcode without the parentheses will render as plaintext and no warning will be emitted.

As an example, this is how an `aside` shortcode-with-body with no arguments would be defined in `aside.html`:
```jinja2
<aside>
    {{ body }}
</aside>
```

We could use it in our Markdown file like so:

```md
Readers can refer to the aside for more information.

{%/* aside() */%}
An aside
{%/* end */%}
```

### Content similar to shortcodes

If you want to have some content that looks like a shortcode but not have Zola try to render it,
you will need to escape it by using `{%/*` and `*/%}` instead of `{%` and `%}`. You won't need to escape
anything else until the closing tag.

## Shortcode context

Every shortcode can access some variables, beyond what you explicitly passed as parameter. These variables are explained in the following subsections:

- invocation count (`nth`)
- current language (`lang`), unless called from the `markdown` template filter (in which case it will always be the same value as `default_language` in configuration, or `en` when it is unset)
- `colocated_path`

When one of these variables conflict with a variable passed as argument, the argument value will be used.

### `nth`: invocation count

Every shortcode context is passed in a variable named `nth` that tracks how many times a particular shortcode has
been invoked in the current Markdown file. Given a shortcode `true_statement.html` template:

```jinja2
<p id="number{{ nth }}">{{ value }} is equal to {{ nth }}.</p>
```

It could be used in our Markdown as follows:

```md
{{/* true_statement(value=1) */}}
{{/* true_statement(value=2) */}}
```

This is useful when implementing custom markup for features such as sidenotes or end notes.

### `lang`: current language
**NOTE:** When calling a shortcode from within the `markdown` template filter, the `lang` variable will always be `en`. 
If you feel like you need that, please consider using template macros instead. 
If you really need that, you can rewrite your Markdown content to pass `lang` as argument to the shortcode.

Every shortcode can access the current language in the `lang` variable in the context. 
This is useful for presenting/filtering information in a shortcode depending in a per-language manner. For example, to display a per-language book cover for the current page in a shortcode called `bookcover.md`:

```jinja2
![Book cover in {{ lang }}](cover.{{ lang }}.png)
```

### `page` or `section`
You can access a slightly stripped down version of the equivalent variables in the normal templates.
The following attributes will be empty:

- translations
- backlinks
- pages

(Note: this is because the rendering of markdown is done before populating the sections)

A useful attribute to `page` in shortcodes is `colocated_path`.
This is used when you want to pass the name of some assets to shortcodes without repeating the full folders path.
Mostly useful when combined with `load_data` or `resize_image`.

```jinja2
{% set resized = resize_image(format="jpg", path=page.colocated_path ~ img_name, width=width, op="fit_width") %}
<img alt="{{ alt }}" src="{{ resized.url | safe }}" />
```

## Examples

Here are some shortcodes for inspiration.

### YouTube

Embed a responsive player for a YouTube video.

The arguments are:

- `id`: the video id (mandatory)
- `playlist`: the playlist id (optional)
- `class`: a class to add to the `<div>` surrounding the iframe
- `autoplay`: when set to "true", the video autoplays on load

Code:

```
<div {% if class %}class="{{class}}"{% endif %}>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/{{id}}{% if playlist %}?list={{playlist}}{% endif %}{% if autoplay %}?autoplay=1{% endif %}" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

Usage example:

```md
{{/* youtube(id="dCKeXuVHl1o") */}}

{{/* youtube(id="dCKeXuVHl1o", playlist="RDdQw4w9WgXcQ") */}}

{{/* youtube(id="dCKeXuVHl1o", autoplay=true) */}}

{{/* youtube(id="dCKeXuVHl1o", autoplay=true, class="youtube") */}}
```

### Image Gallery

Zola comes with built-in syntax highlighting but you first
need to enable it in the [configuration](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md).

Once this is done, Zola will automatically highlight all code blocks
in your content. A code block in Markdown looks like the following:

````
```rust
let highlight = true;
```
````

You can replace `rust` with another language or not put anything to get the text
interpreted as plain text.

```

Note: due to some issues with the JavaScript syntax, the TypeScript syntax will be used instead.

If the language you want to highlight is not on this list, the `extra_syntaxes_and_themes` configuration option can be used to add additional syntax and theme files.

If your site source is laid out as follows:

```
.
├── config.toml
├── content/
│   └── ...
├── static/
│   └── ...
├── syntaxes/
│   ├── Sublime-Language1/
│   │   └── lang1.sublime-syntax
│   └── lang2.sublime-syntax
└── templates/
    └── ...
```

you would set your `extra_syntaxes_and_themes` to `["syntaxes", "syntaxes/Sublime-Language1"]` to load `lang1.sublime-syntax` and `lang2.sublime-syntax`.

You can see the list of available themes on the [configuration page](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md#syntax-highlighting).


## Inline VS classed highlighting

If you use a highlighting scheme like

```toml
highlight_theme = "base16-ocean-dark"
```

for a code block like

````md
```rs
let highlight = true;
```
````

you get the colors directly encoded in the html file.

```html
<pre class="language-rs" style="background-color:#2b303b;">
    <code class="language-rs">
        <span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span>
        <span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> highlight = </span>
        <span style="color:#d08770;">true</span>
        <span style="color:#c0c5ce;">;
    </span>
  </code>
</pre>
```

This is nice, because your page will load faster if everything is in one file.
But if you would like to have the user choose a theme from a
list, or use different color schemes for dark/light color schemes, you need a
different solution.

If you use the special `css` color scheme

```toml
highlight_theme = "css"
```

you get CSS class definitions, instead.

```html
<pre class="language-rs">
    <code class="language-rs">
        <span class="z-source z-rust">
            <span class="z-storage z-type z-rust">let</span> highlight
            <span class="z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-rust">=</span>
            <span class="z-constant z-language z-rust">true</span>
            <span class="z-punctuation z-terminator z-rust">;</span>
        </span>
    </code>
</pre>
```

Zola can output a css file for a theme in the `static` directory using the `highlight_themes_css` option.

```toml
highlight_themes_css = [
  { theme = "base16-ocean-dark", filename = "syntax-theme-dark.css" },
  { theme = "base16-ocean-light", filename = "syntax-theme-light.css" },
]
```

You can then support light and dark mode like so:

```css
@import url("syntax-theme-dark.css") (prefers-color-scheme: dark);
@import url("syntax-theme-light.css") (prefers-color-scheme: light);
```

Alternately, you can reference the stylesheets in your base template to reduce request chains:

```html
<head>
  <!-- Other content -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/syntax-theme-dark.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/syntax-theme-light.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
</head>
```

Themes can conditionally include code-highlighting stylesheet `<link>` tags by wrapping them in a conditional:

```jinja2
{% if config.markdown.highlight_code and config.markdown.highlight_theme == "css" %}
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/syntax-theme-dark.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/syntax-theme-light.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
{% endif %}
```


## Annotations

You can use additional annotations to customize how code blocks are displayed:

- `linenos` to enable line numbering.

````
```rust,linenos
use highlighter::highlight;
let code = "...";
highlight(code);
```
````

- `linenostart` to specify the number for the first line (defaults to 1)
  
````
```rust,linenos,linenostart=20
use highlighter::highlight;
let code = "...";
highlight(code);
```
````

- `hl_lines` to highlight lines. You must specify a list of inclusive ranges of lines to highlight,
separated by ` ` (whitespace). Ranges are 1-indexed and `linenostart` doesn't influence the values, it always refers to the codeblock line number.
  
````
```rust,hl_lines=1 3-5 9
use highlighter::highlight;
let code = "...";
highlight(code);
```
````

- `hide_lines` to hide lines. You must specify a list of inclusive ranges of lines to hide,
separated by ` ` (whitespace). Ranges are 1-indexed.

````
```rust,hide_lines=1-2
use highlighter::highlight;
let code = "...";
highlight(code);
```
````

- `name` to specify a name the code block is associated with.
  
````
```rust,name=mod.rs
use highlighter::highlight;
let code = "...";
highlight(code);
```
````

## Styling codeblocks

Depending on the annotations used, some codeblocks will be hard to read without any CSS. We recommend using the following
snippet in your sites:

```css
pre {
  padding: 1rem;
  overflow: auto;
}
/* The line numbers already provide some kind of left/right padding */
pre[data-linenos] {
  padding: 1rem 0;
}
pre table td {
  padding: 0;
}
/* The line number cells */
pre table td:nth-of-type(1) {
  text-align: center;
  vertical-align: top;
  user-select: none;
}
pre mark {
  /* If you want your highlights to take the full width */
  display: block;
  /* The default background colour of a mark is bright yellow */
  background-color: rgba(254, 252, 232, 0.9);
}
pre table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

This snippet makes the highlighting work on the full width and ensures that a user can copy the content without
selecting the line numbers. Obviously you will probably need to adjust it to fit your site style.

Here's an example with all the options used: `scss, linenos, linenostart=10, hl_lines=3-4 8-9, hide_lines=2 7` with the
snippet above.

```scss, linenos, linenostart=10, hl_lines=3-4 8-9, hide_lines=2 7
pre mark {
  // If you want your highlights to take the full width
  display: block;
  color: currentcolor;
}
pre table td:nth-of-type(1) {
  // Select a colour matching your theme
  color: #6b6b6b;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

Line 2 and 7 are comments that are not shown in the final output.

When line numbers are active, the code block is turned into a table with one row and two cells. The first cell contains the line number and the second cell contains the code.
Highlights are done via the `<mark>` HTML tag. When a line with line number is highlighted two `<mark>` tags are created: one around the line number(s) and one around the code.

## Custom Highlighting Themes

The default *theme* for syntax highlighting is called `base16-ocean-dark`, you can choose another theme from the built in set of highlight themes using the `highlight_theme` configuration option.
For example, this documentation site currently uses the `kronuz` theme, which is built in.

```
[markdown]
highlight_code = true
highlight_theme = "kronuz"
```

Alternatively, the `extra_syntaxes_and_themes` configuration option can be used to add additional theme files.
You can load your own highlight theme from a TextMate `.tmTheme` file.

It works the same way as adding extra syntaxes. It should contain a list of paths to folders containing the .tmTheme files you want to include.
You would then set `highlight_theme` to the name of one of these files, without the `.tmTheme` extension.

If your site source is laid out as follows:

```
.
├── config.toml
├── content/
│   └── ...
├── static/
│   └── ...
├── highlight_themes/
│   ├── MyGroovyTheme/
│   │   └── theme1.tmTheme
│   ├── theme2.tmTheme
└── templates/
    └── ...
```

you would set your `extra_syntaxes_and_themes` to `["highlight_themes", "highlight_themes/MyGroovyTheme"]` to load `theme1.tmTheme` and `theme2.tmTheme`.
Then choose one of them to use, say theme1, by setting `highlight_theme = theme1`.

Each page/section will automatically generate a table of contents for itself based on the headers generated with markdown.

It is available in the template through the `page.toc` or `section.toc` variable.
You can view the [template variables](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md#table-of-contents)
documentation for information on its structure.

Here is an example of using that field to render a two-level table of contents:

```jinja2
{% if page.toc %}
    <ul>
    {% for h1 in page.toc %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ h1.permalink | safe }}">{{ h1.title }}</a>
            {% if h1.children %}
                <ul>
                    {% for h2 in h1.children %}
                        <li>
                            <a href="{{ h2.permalink | safe }}">{{ h2.title }}</a>
                        </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            {% endif %}
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endif %}
```

While headers are neatly ordered in this example, it will work just as well with disjoint headers.

Note that all existing HTML tags from the title will NOT be present in the table of contents to
avoid various issues.

Zola has built-in support for taxonomies. Taxonomies are a way for users to group content according to user-defined categories.

## Definitions

- Taxonomy: A category that can be used to group content 
- Term: A specific group within a taxonomy 
- Value: A piece of content that can be associated with a term

## Example: a movie website

Imagine that you want to make a website to display information about various movies. In that case you could use the following taxonomies:

- Director
- Genres
- Awards
- Release year

Then at build time Zola can create pages for each taxonomy listing all of the known terms as well as pages for each term in a taxonomy, listing all of the pieces of content associated with that term. 

Imagine again we have the following movies: 
```
- Shape of water                   <--- Value
  - Director                         <--- Taxonomy
    - Guillermo Del Toro                 <--- Term
  - Genres                            <--- Taxonomy
    - Thriller                           <--- Term
    - Drama                              <--- Term
  - Awards                           <--- Taxonomy
    - Golden globe                         <--- Term
    - Academy award                        <--- Term
    - BAFTA                                <--- Term
  - Release year                      <--- Taxonomy
    - 2017                                <--- Term
    
- The Room:                         <--- Value
  - Director                           <--- Taxonomy
    - Tommy Wiseau                         <--- Term
  - Genres                              <--- Taxonomy
    - Romance                              <--- Term
    - Drama                                <--- Term
  - Release Year                       <--- Taxonomy
    - 2003                                 <--- Term

- Bright                           <--- Value
  - Director                           <--- Taxonomy
    - David Ayer                           <--- Term
  - Genres                              <--- Taxonomy
    - Fantasy                              <--- Term
    - Action                               <--- Term
  - Awards                             <--- Taxonomy
    - California on Location Awards        <--- Term
  - Release Year                       <--- Taxonomy
    - 2017                                 <--- Term
```

In this example the page for `Release year` would include links to pages for both 2003 and 2017, where the page for 2017 would list both Shape of Water and Bright.

## Configuration

A taxonomy has six variables:

- `name`: a required string that will be used in the URLs, usually the plural version (i.e., tags, categories, etc.)
- `paginate_by`: if this is set to a number, each term page will be paginated by this much.
- `paginate_path`: if set, this path will be used by the paginated page and the page number will be appended after it.
For example the default would be page/1.
- `feed`: if set to `true`, a feed (atom by default) will be generated for each term.
- `lang`: only set this if you are making a multilingual site and want to indicate which language this taxonomy is for
- `render`: if set to `false`, pages will not be rendered for the taxonomy or for individual terms.

Insert into the configuration file (config.toml):

⚠️ Place the taxonomies key in the main section and not in the `[extra]` section

**Example 1:** (one language)

```toml
taxonomies = [
    { name = "director", feed = true},
    { name = "genres", feed = true},
    { name = "awards", feed = true},
    { name = "release-year", feed = true},
]
```

**Example 2:** (multilingual site)

```toml
# These taxonomies go in the main section
taxonomies = [
    {name = "director", feed = true},
    {name = "genres", feed = true},
    {name = "awards", feed = true},
    {name = "release-year", feed = true},
]

[languages.fr]
taxonomies = [
    {name = "director", feed = true},
    {name = "genres", feed = true},
    {name = "awards", feed = true},
    {name = "release-year", feed = true},
]
```

## Using taxonomies

Once the configuration is done, you can then set taxonomies in your content and Zola will pick them up:

**Example:**

```toml
+++
title = "Shape of water"
date = 2019-08-15 # date of the post, not the movie
[taxonomies]
director=["Guillermo Del Toro"]
genres=["Thriller","Drama"]
awards=["Golden Globe", "Academy award", "BAFTA"]
release-year = ["2017"]
+++
```

## Output paths

In a similar manner to how section and pages calculate their output path:
- the taxonomy name is never slugified
- the taxonomy term (e.g. as specific tag) is slugified when `slugify.taxonomies` is enabled (`"on"`, the default) in the configuration

The taxonomy pages are then available at the following paths:

```txt
$BASE_URL/$NAME/ (taxonomy)
$BASE_URL/$NAME/$SLUG (taxonomy entry)
```
Note that taxonomies are case insensitive so terms that have the same slug will get merged, e.g. sections and pages containing the tag "example" will be shown in the same taxonomy page as ones containing "Example"

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering static website hosting. We're going to look at the setup required to build and deploy your Zola website to S3 via GitHub Actions.

## AWS Setup

[The official AWS developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started-cloudfront-overview.html) guide has detailed instruction on how to create your bucket and set it up correctly for static website hosting. In AWS you can not only host the website files, but also buy a domain name and speed up your website via their global CDN (CloudFront).

For GitHub Actions to modify the files in your bucket, you need to create an IAM user in your AWS account that has just enough permissions to perform what we need and no more.

First we need to create a new policy by logging on to AWS Console and going to **IAM** > **Policies** > **Create policy**. Switch from the visual editor to **JSON** and paste the following snippet. Remember to update your bucket name:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AccessToWebsiteBuckets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutBucketWebsite",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name"
        "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AccessToCloudfront",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["cloudfront:GetInvalidation", "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `AccessToCloudfront` portion is not required if you're not going to speed up your website with CloudFront.

Once the policy is created you need to create a new user under **IAM** > **Users**. Give it a name such as `github-actions-user`. On the **Set permissions** step select **Attach policies directly** and find the policy we created in the last step. 

From the list of users click on your newly created account and then open the **Security Credentials** tab. Under **Access keys** select > **Create access key** and choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. Click "I understand the above recommendation" and then **Create access key**. Note the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.

## Setup Secrets in GitHub

The access keys we just created need to be configured as secrets in your GitHub repo. To do so, navigate to **Setting** > expand **Secrets and variables** > click on **Actions**.

Under **Repository secrets** click **Add repository secret**. In the *Name* field enter `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and in the  *Secret* field enter the value from the previous step. Do the same for the secret access key, naming it `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Finally create one secret for your bucket name `S3_BUCKET` and one `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` if you have created a distribution for your website.

## GitHub Actions

Next we need to create the *Github Action* to build and deploy our files to S3. We need to create a workflow file in `.github/workflows` directory of our repository. This can be done by navigating to the *Actions* tab in GitHub or by committing the file from your machine.

`.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build and Publish to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: zola@0.17.2
      - name: Build
        run: zola build
      - uses: reggionick/s3-deploy@v4
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        with:
          folder: public
          bucket: ${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET }}
          private: true
          bucket-region: us-east-1
          # Use the next two only if you have created a CloudFront distribution
          dist-id: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID }}
          invalidation: /*
```

Note, that you may need to change the branch name in the above snippet if you desire a different behavior.

Cloudflare is a cloud solutions provider with a huge proprietary content delivery network (CDN). Like Netlify or Vercel, Cloudflare Pages makes the deployment process flexible and easy. You can add a GitHub repo to the service and build & host Zola-based websites after each PR automatically.

## Step-by-step

1. Sign in or create a new Cloudflare account and choose _"Pages"_ on the right nav column
2. Press the button _"Create a project"_
3. Select the GitHub repo that contains your Zola website and connect it to Cloudflare Pages
4. Click _"Begin setup"_
5. Enter your project name. Keep in mind that if you would like to use the default Pages domain (pages.dev), this will be your website's future URL ("yourprojectname.pages.dev"). Additionally, select a production branch.
6. In _Build settings_, select Zola as the _Framework preset_. _Build command_ and _Build output directory_ will be filled automatically.
7. Toggle _Environment variables_ below and add `ZOLA_VERSION` as _a variable name_. Use `0.17.2` or a different Zola version as the _value_.
8. Finally, save and deploy.

Your website is now built and deployed to Cloudflare's network! You can add a custom domain or modify settings in the Pages dashboard.

You may find documentation and guides like [Getting started with Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/getting-started) and
[Deploying Zola with Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/deploy-a-zola-site#deploying-with-cloudflare-pages) in the Developers portal.

## Handling preview deployments

When working with Cloudflare Pages, you'll often use preview deployments for testing changes before merging to your main branch. By default, these preview deployments use different URLs (like `https://your-branch-name.your-project.pages.dev`), which can cause issues with asset loading if your `base_url` is hardcoded in your `config.toml`.

To fix this, modify your build command in the Cloudflare Pages configuration to dynamically set the base URL depending on the environment:

```sh
if [ "$CF_PAGES_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then zola build; else zola build --base-url $CF_PAGES_URL; fi
```

This command:

- Uses your `config.toml` `base_url` when building from the main branch
- Uses the preview deployment URL (automatically provided by Cloudflare Pages as `$CF_PAGES_URL`) for all other branches

## Troubleshooting

Some tips to help troubleshoot issues getting started with Cloudflare Pages.

### `zola: not found`

If you see build output that resembles something like this:

```sh
23:03:54.609	> build
23:03:54.609	> zola build $BUILD_OPTS && npx tailwindcss -i ./public/input.css -o ./public/style.css -m
23:03:54.609
23:03:54.621	sh: 1: zola: not found
23:03:54.635	Failed: Error while executing user command. Exited with error code: 127
23:03:54.644	Failed: build command exited with code: 1
23:03:55.699	Failed: error occurred while running build command
```

Then it might be due to an [outstanding issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-build-image/issues/3#issuecomment-1646873666). There are currently two recommended workarounds:

#### Change the **build system version** to `v1`

From within the workers & pages dash, go to the following:
<Your Project> Settings > Builds & deployments > Build system version > Configure build system

Then select `v1` and save.

#### Or use `UNSTABLE_PRE_BUILD` environment variable + `asdf`

From within the workers & pages dash, do the following:
<Your Project> Settings > Environment variables > Edit variables

And add an environment variable `UNSTABLE_PRE_BUILD`, with the following value and save.

```sh
asdf plugin add zola https://github.com/salasrod/asdf-zola && asdf install zola 0.18.0 && asdf global zola 0.18.0
```

We are going to use the Woodpecker CI hosted by Codeberg to host the site on Codeberg Pages.

## Configuring your repository

It is required that you create a repository on Codeberg that contains only your Zola project. The [Zola directory structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/) should be in the root of your repository.

Information on how to create and manage a repository on Codeberg can be found at <https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/first-repository/>.

## Ensuring that Woodpecker CI can access your theme

Depending on how you added your theme, your repository may not contain it. The best way to ensure that the theme is added is to use submodules. Make sure you use the `https` version of the URL.

```bash
git submodule add <theme_url> themes/<theme_name>
```

For example, this could look like:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/getzola/hyde.git themes/hyde
```

## Setting up Woodpecker CI

Assuming you have access to [Codeberg's Woodpecker CI](https://docs.codeberg.org/ci/), we can build the site and automatically deploy it to [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page) on every commit.

First, place the following sample [Zola CI file](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg-CI/examples/src/branch/main/Zola/.woodpecker.yaml) in the root of your project:

```yaml
# Exclude the pipeline to run on the pages branch
when:
  branch:
    exclude: pages

# Clone recursively to fully clone the themes given as Git submodules
clone:
  git:
    image: woodpeckerci/plugin-git
    settings:
      recursive: true

steps:
  # Build Zola static files
  build:
    image: alpine:edge
    commands:
      - apk add zola
      - zola build
    when:
      event: [push, pull_request]

  publish:
    image: bitnami/git
    environment:
      CBMAIL:
        from_secret: "mail"
      CBTOKEN:
        from_secret: "codeberg_token"
    commands:
      # Configure Git
      - git config --global user.email "$${CBMAIL}"
      - git config --global user.name "Woodpecker CI"
      # Clone the output branch
      - git clone --branch pages https://$${CBTOKEN}@codeberg.org/$CI_REPO.git $CI_REPO_NAME
      # Enter the output branch
      - cd $CI_REPO_NAME
      # Remove old files
      - git rm -r "*" || true # Don't fail if there's nothing to remove
      # Copy the output of the build step
      - cp -ar ../public/. .
      # Commit and push all static files with the source commit hash
      - git add --all
      - git commit -m "Woodpecker CI ${CI_COMMIT_SHA} [SKIP CI]" --allow-empty
      - git push
    when:
      event: [push]
```

Then add the following secrets to [Woodpecker](https://ci.codeberg.org/):

- `mail`: Your email address as used by Codeberg.
- `codeberg_token`: [Codeberg access token](https://docs.codeberg.org/advanced/access-token/) with `write:repository` permission.

Once done, you can trigger the CI by pushing something to the repository, and Woodpecker will build the site and copy the resulting site to the `pages` branch and it will be available at `https://<user>.codeberg.page/<repository>`.

For [custom domain](https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/using-custom-domain/), create the `.domains` file inside the `./static/` directory so that it will be copied to the resulting build.

More information about Codeberg Pages is available in the [official Codeberg documentation](https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/).

File: docs/content/documentation/deployment/docker-image.md
================
+++
title = "Docker image"
weight = 90
+++

If you have to distribute a Zola based web site through Docker, it's easy to do with a multi-stage build.

Here is an example that builds the current folder, and put the result in a docker image that will be served by
[static-web-server](https://static-web-server.net/), a minimalist web server written in rust.

Of course, you may want to replace the second stage with another static web server like Nginx or Apache.

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.1 as zola

COPY . /project
WORKDIR /project
RUN ["zola", "build"]

FROM ghcr.io/static-web-server/static-web-server:2
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=zola /project/public /public
```

To build your website as a docker image, you then run:
```shell
docker build -t my_website:latest .
```

To test your site, just run the docker image and browse [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

```
docker run --rm -p 8000:80 my_website:latest
```

Note that, if you want to be able to use your docker image from multiple locations, you'll have to set `base_url` to `/`.

If you don't have an account with Edgio, you can sign up [here](https://app.layer0.co/signup).

## Manual deploys

For a command-line manual deploy, follow these steps:

1. Install the Edgio CLI: 

```bash
npm i -g @edgio/cli
```

2. Create a package.json at the root of your project with the following:

```bash
npm init -y
```

3. Initialize your project with:

```bash
edgio init
```

4. Update routes.js at the root of your project to the following:

```js
// This file was added by edgio init.
// You should commit this file to source control.

import { Router } from '@edgio/core/router'

export default new Router().static('public')
```

5. Build your zola app:

```bash
zola build
```

6. Deploy!

```bash
edgio deploy
```

If you don't have an account with fly.io, you can sign up [here](https://fly.io/app/sign-up).

Then install the `flyctl` tool following the instructions [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/).

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.2 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN ["zola", "build"]

FROM joseluisq/static-web-server:2
COPY --from=builder /app/public /public
ENV SERVER_PORT 8080
```

You can now run `fly launch`. It will detect the `Dockerfile` and mostly auto-configure everything. Fill out the necessary information, but say "no" to (1) launching any databases and (2) deploying immediately.

Take note of the hostname assigned to your app.

If you already have a Zola site you must now ensure that `base_url` in `config.toml` is set correctly using the hostname from your app (or whatever domain you have pointing to the app):

    base_url = "https://white-snow-9922.fly.dev"

If you don't have an existing site, initialize one with `zola init -f` and remember to set the correct `base_url`.

You're now ready to launch your site! Run `flyctl deploy` and have fun!

Finally, to set up continuous deployment of your site from GitHub, follow [this](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/) guide, steps 4-8. Any changes to your site will now be pushed automatically.

File: docs/content/documentation/deployment/github-pages.md

title = "GitHub Pages"

By default, GitHub Pages uses Jekyll (a ruby based static site generator),
but you can also publish any generated files provided you have an `index.html` file in the root of a branch called
`gh-pages`, `main` or `master`. In addition you can publish from a `docs` directory in your repository. That branch name can
also be manually changed in the settings of a repository. To serve a site at `<username>.github.io` or
`<organization>.github.io`, you must name the repository `<username>.github.io` or
`<organization>.github.io` (otherwise GitHub will append the repository name to the URL, e.g.:
`<username>.github.io/<repositoryname>`.

We can use any continuous integration (CI) server to build and deploy our site. For example:

 * [Github Actions](#github-actions)
 * [Travis CI](#travis-ci)

In either case, it seems to work best if you use `git submodule` to include your theme, e.g.:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/getzola/after-dark.git themes/after-dark
```

## Github Actions

Using *Github Actions* for the deployment of your Zola-Page on Github-Pages is pretty easy. You basically need three things:

1. A *Personal access token* to give the *Github Action* the permission to push into your repository ONLY IF you are publishing from another repo
2. Create the *Github Action*.
3. Check the *Github Pages* section in repository settings.

Let's start with the token. Remember, if you are publishing the site on the same repo, you do not need to follow that step. But you will still need to pass in the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#example-1-passing-the-github_token-as-an-input).

For creating the token either click on [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo) or go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens. Under the *Select Scopes* section, give it *public_repo* permissions and click *Generate token*. Then copy the token, navigate to your repository and add in the Settings tab the *Secret* `TOKEN` and paste your token in it.

Next we need to create the *Github Action*. Here we can make use of the [zola-deploy-action](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action). Go to the *Actions* tab of your repository, click on *set up a workflow yourself* to get a blank workflow file. Copy the following script into it and commit it afterwards; note that you may need to change the `github.ref` branch from `main` to `master` or similar, as the action will only run for the branch you choose.
If you get a permissions denied error, you may need to change the workflow permissions to read and write in Settings > Actions > Workflow permissions.

```yaml
# On every push this script is executed
on: push
name: Build and deploy GH Pages
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: build_and_deploy
        uses: shalzz/zola-deploy-action@master
        env:
          # Target branch
          PAGES_BRANCH: gh-pages
          # Provide personal access token
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          # Or if publishing to the same repo, use the automatic token
          #TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This script is pretty simple, because the [zola-deploy-action](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action) is doing everything for you. You just need to provide some details. For more configuration options check out the [README](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action/blob/master/README.md).

By committing the action your first build is triggered. Wait until it's finished, then you should see in your repository a new branch *gh-pages* with the compiled *Zola* page in it.

Finally we need to check the *Github Pages* section of the repository settings. Click on the *Settings* tab and scroll down to the *Github Pages* section. Check if the source is set to *gh-pages* branch and the directory is */ (root)*. You should also see your *Github Pages* link.

There you can also configure a *custom domain* and *Enforce HTTPS* mode. Before configuring a *custom domains*, please check out [this](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action/blob/master/README.md#custom-domain).

If you want to keep the source of your site in a private repository (including, for example, draft
posts), adapt the following `.github/workflows/main.yml` (making sure to update the branches as required):

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref != 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: 'checkout'
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: 'build'
        uses: shalzz/zola-deploy-action@master
        env:
          PAGES_BRANCH: gh-pages
          BUILD_DIR: .
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          # BUILD_ONLY: true
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: 'checkout'
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: 'build and deploy'
        uses: shalzz/zola-deploy-action@master
        env:
          PAGES_BRANCH: master
          BUILD_DIR: .
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PUBLIC_TOKEN }}
          REPOSITORY: username/username.github.io
```
by substituting your username or organization.

## Travis CI

Alternatively, you can use [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) to automatically publish the site. If you are not using Travis
already, you will need to login with the GitHub OAuth and activate Travis for the repository.
Don't forget to also check if your repository allows GitHub Pages in its settings.

## Ensure that Travis can access your theme

Depending on how you added your theme, Travis may not know how to access
it. The best way to ensure that it will have full access to the theme is to use git
submodules. When doing this, ensure that you are using the `https` version of the URL.

```bash
$ git submodule add {THEME_URL} themes/{THEME_NAME}
```

### Allowing Travis to push to GitHub

Before pushing anything, Travis needs a Github private access key to make changes to your repository.
If you're already logged in to your account, just click [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to go to
your tokens page.
Otherwise, navigate to `Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens`.
Generate a new token and give it any description you'd like.
Under the "Select Scopes" section, give it repo permissions. Click "Generate token" to finish up.

Your token will now be visible.
Copy it into your clipboard and head back to Travis.
Once on Travis, click on your project, and navigate to "Settings". Scroll down to "Environment Variables" and input a name of `GH_TOKEN` with a value of your access token.
Make sure that "Display value in build log" is off, and then click add. Now Travis has access to your repository.

### Setting up Travis

We're almost done. We just need some scripts in a .travis.yml file to tell Travis what to do.

**NOTE**: The script below assumes that we're taking the code from the `code` branch and will generate the HTML to be published in the `master` branch of the same repository. You're free to use any other branch for the Markdown files but if you want to use `<username>.github.io` or `<org>.github.io`, the destination branch **MUST** be `master`.

```yaml
language: minimal

before_script:
  # Download and unzip the zola executable
  # Replace the version numbers in the URL by the version you want to use
  - curl -s -L https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases/download/v0.13.0/zola-v0.13.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | sudo tar xvzf - -C /usr/local/bin

script:
  - zola build

# If you are using a different folder than `public` for the output directory, you will
# need to change the `zola` command and the `ghp-import` path
after_success: |
  [ $TRAVIS_BRANCH = code ] &&
  [ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST = false ] &&
  zola build &&
  sudo pip install ghp-import &&
  ghp-import -n public -b master &&
  git push -fq https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/${TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG}.git master
```

If your site is using a custom domain, you will need to mention it in the `ghp-import` command:
`ghp-import -c vaporsoft.net -n public` for example.

Credits: The Travis-CI section of this page is based on the article https://vaporsoft.net/publishing-gutenberg-to-github/

## Custom Domain

If you're using a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, put the CNAME in static/CNAME so that Zola puts it in the root of the public folder which is where GitHub expects it to be.

We are going to use the GitLab Runner in GitLab CI/CD to host
the site on GitLab Pages.

## Configuring your repository

It is possible to host your Zola site on either the SaaS instance offered by
GitLab (<https://gitlab.com>) or on a self-hosted instance.

It is recommended to create a repository on GitLab that contains solely your
Zola project. The [Zola's directory structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/)
should be located in the root directory of your repository.

For information on how to create and manage a repository on GitLab, refer to:

<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/>

## Ensuring that the runner can access your theme

Depending on how you added your theme, your repository may not contain it.
The best way to ensure that the theme will be added is to use submodules.
When doing this, ensure that you are using the `https` version of the URL.

```bash
git submodule add {THEME_URL} themes/{THEME_NAME}
```

For example, this could look like:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/getzola/hyde.git themes/hyde
```

## Setting up the GitLab Runner

The GitLab Runner needs to know how to create your site in order to deploy
it to the GitLab Pages server.

We provide you with a template to accomplish this task easily.
Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root directory of your
repository and copy the contents of the template below.

Make sure you specify a version of Zola in the `ZOLA_VERSION` variable.

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

default:
  image: debian:stable-slim

variables:
  # The runner will be able to pull your Zola theme when the strategy is
  # set to "recursive".
  GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: "recursive"

  # Make sure you specify a version of Zola here.
  # Use the semver format (x.y.z) to specify a version.
  # For example: "0.17.2" or "0.18.0".
  ZOLA_VERSION:
    description: "The version of Zola used to build the site."
    value: ""

pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - |
      apt-get update
      DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates
      zola_url="https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases/download/v${ZOLA_VERSION}/zola-v${ZOLA_VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
      if ! wget --quiet --spider $zola_url; then
        echo "A Zola release with the specified version could not be found."
        exit 1
      fi
      wget $zola_url
      tar -xzf *.tar.gz
      ./zola build --base-url $CI_PAGES_URL

  artifacts:
    paths:
      # This is the directory whose contents will be deployed to the GitLab Pages server.
      # GitLab Pages expects a directory with this name by default.
      - public

  rules:
    # This rule makes it so that your website is published and updated only when
    # you push to the default branch of your repository (e.g. "master" or "main").
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

Please, keep in mind that this template assumes you are using the
[Docker executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html)
on your GitLab Runner.
Feel free to adjust the file to your workflow and specific requirements.

After you push this file to the default branch of your repository
(e.g. "master" or "main"), your site will be ready. The GitLab CI/CD pipelines
will ensure your site is published and updated automatically.

On the left sidebar of GitLab, navigate to **Deploy > Pages** to find the URL of your
website inside the **Access pages** section.

More information on how to host your site on GitLab Pages is available
[in the official GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).

================
+++
title = "Netlify"
weight = 20
+++

If you don't have an account with Netlify, you can [sign up](https://app.netlify.com) for one.


## Automatic deploys

Once you are in the admin interface, you can add a site from a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). At the end
 of this process, you can select the deploy settings for the project:

 - build command: `zola build` (replace the version number in the variable by the version you want to use)
 - publish directory: the path to where the `public` directory is
 - image selection: use the latest
 - Environment variables: `ZOLA_VERSION` with for example `0.13.0` as value

With this setup, your site should be automatically deployed on every commit on master.  For `ZOLA_VERSION`, you may
use any of the tagged `release` versions in the GitHub repository. Netlify will automatically fetch the tagged version
and use it to build your site.

However, if you want to use everything that Netlify gives you, you should also publish temporary sites for pull requests.

This is done by adding the following `netlify.toml` file in your repository and removing the build command/publish
directory in the admin interface.

```toml
[build]
# This assumes that the Zola site is in a docs folder. If it isn't, you don't need
# to have a `base` variable but you do need the `publish` and `command` variables.
base    = "docs"
publish = "docs/public"
command = "zola build"

[build.environment]
# Set the version name that you want to use and Netlify will automatically use it.
ZOLA_VERSION = "0.13.0"

# The magic for deploying previews of branches.
# We need to override the base url with whatever url Netlify assigns to our
# preview site.  We do this using the Netlify environment variable
# `$DEPLOY_PRIME_URL`.

[context.deploy-preview]
command = "zola build --base-url $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"
```

## Manual deploys
If you would prefer to use a version of Zola that isn't a tagged release (for example, after having built Zola from
source and made modifications), then you will need to manually deploy your `public` folder to Netlify.  You can do
this through Netlify's web GUI or via the command line.

For a command-line manual deploy, follow these steps:
 1.  Generate a `Personal Access Token` from the settings section of your Netlify account (*not* an OAuth Application).
 2.  Build your site with `zola build`.
 3.  Create a zip folder containing the `public` directory.
 4.  Run the `curl` command below, filling in your values for PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1, FILE_NAME.zip
 and SITE_NAME.
 5.  (Optional) delete the zip folder.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1" \
     --data-binary "@FILE_NAME.zip" \
     https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/sites/SITE_NAME.netlify.com/deploys
```

Deploying your static Zola website on [Sourcehut Pages][srht] is very simple.

You need to create a `.build.yml` manifest file in the root folder of your Zola project and push your changes to the
Sourcehut git/hg repository.
To create your `.build.yml` file you can start with [a template][srht-tpl] or use the following example:
``` yaml
image: alpine/edge
packages:
  - hut
  - zola
oauth: pages.sr.ht/PAGES:RW
environment:
  site: your_username.srht.site
sources:
  - https://git.sr.ht/~your_username/my-website
tasks:
  - build: |
      cd my-website
      zola build
  - package: |
      cd my-website
      tar -C public -cvz . > ../site.tar.gz
  - upload: |
      hut pages publish -d $site site.tar.gz
```

This manifest will clone your source code, build the website and upload the generated static files to the domain
you specified in `site`.
For publishing the website, the build manifest uses `hut`, a commandline tool which takes care of automatically
generating authentication tokens, so there is nothing else you need to do.

From this template you need to customize the variable `site` with the domain that will host your website and
`sources` to point to your Sourcehut git/hg public URL (in this example `my-website` is the name of the repository).

Then commit and push your changes:
``` sh
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
...
remote: Build started:
remote: https://builds.sr.ht/~your_username/job/430625 [.build.yml]
To git.sr.ht:~your_username/www
   fbe9afa..59ae556  master -> master
```

The build job will be automatically triggered.
Notice that Sourcehut returns a direct link to the build page, where you can check the progress and success status.

By default you can use a subdomain of Sourcehut Pages to host your static website - `your_username.srht.site`.
If you want to use a custom domain (e.g. "blog.mydomain.org"), you will need to configure a DNS record to point to
the Sourcehut server.
Instructions on how to do this are available on [Sourcehut][srht-custom-domain].

title = "Vercel"

Vercel (previously Zeit) is similar to Netlify, making the deployment of your site easy as pie.
The sites are hosted by Vercel and automatically deployed whenever we push a commit to our
selected production branch (e.g, master).

If you don't have an account with Vercel, you can sign up [here](https://vercel.com/signup).

## Automatic deploys

Once you sign up you can import your site from a Git provider (Github, GitLab or Bitbucket). 
When you import your repository, Vercel will try to find out what framework your site is using.

If it doesn't default to Zola:
- Set Framework Preset as **Zola**.

By default, Vercel chooses output directory as `public`. If you use a different directory, then
specify output directory under the "Build and Output Settings" dropdown.
You can learn more about how to setup a custom domain and how to get the most out of Vercel
[via their documentation.](https://vercel.com/docs) 

After you click the blue "Deploy" button, it's off to the races!

To use a specific version of Zola, set [`ZOLA_VERSION`](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#specifying-framework-versions) environment variable in project settings to a valid
release tag, for example `0.17.2`.

## Troubleshooting

### `GLIBC_X.XX` not found

This is because Vercel's build images comes with an older glibc version whereas Zola 
depends on a newer glibc. However, Vercel provides a newer build image which can be used in
deployments by setting Node.js version to "20.x", allowing Zola to work properly.

## Additional options

### Enable trailing slashes

Visiting a page without trailing slash may break relative paths, so you might want to configure
Vercel to always redirect paths with a trailing slash. By default, redirecting to a trailing
slash is not enabled on Vercel.

For example if you have an `about.md` file, and when visiting the path without a trailing
slash, like `/about`, Vercel will redirect with trailing slash, resulting in `/about/`.
Paths with a file extension will not redirect to a trailing slash, for example if you
have a static file named `favicon.ico`, it will stay as-is.

To enable that, create a file in the root of your git repository named `vercel.json`
(if it doesn't exists already), and set this option:

```json
{
    "trailingSlash": true
}
```

### Prefer clean URLs

When enabled, all HTML files will be served without their file extension. For example
if you have an `about.md` file, Zola will generate a `about/index.html` file, but Vercel
will serve the file as `/about`, without its `index.html` suffix.

To enable that, create a file in the root of your git repository named `vercel.json`
(if it doesn't exists already), and set this option:

```json
{
    "cleanUrls": true
}
```

### Using a custom Zola binary

If you want to use your own Zola binary that published on GitHub, or if you want to
always use the latest version of Zola, you can run a shell command to grab the
latest release from GitHub.

To do that, set "Framework Preset" to "Other", and override "Install Command" to:

```bash
REPO="getzola/zola"; curl -fsS https://api.github.com/repos/${REPO}/releases/latest | grep -oP '"browser_download_url": ?"\K(.+linux-gnu.tar.gz)' | xargs -n 1 curl -fsSL -o zola.tar.gz && tar -xzvf zola.tar.gz
```

This command will fetch the latest release from GitHub, download the archive and extract it.

Then, set "Build Command" to `./zola build`. Now Vercel will use the downloaded Zola 
binary to build the documentation instead of using the built-in one.

If you prefer to use `vercel.json` instead, (which overrides the options set in the dashboard)
you can use this configuration.

```json
{
    "framework": null,
    "installCommand": "REPO=\"getzola/zola\"; curl -fsS https://api.github.com/repos/${REPO}/releases/latest | grep -oP '\"browser_download_url\": ?\"\\K(.+linux-gnu.tar.gz)' | xargs -n 1 curl -fsSL -o zola.tar.gz && tar -xzvf zola.tar.gz",
    "buildCommand": "./zola build",
    "outputDirectory": "public"
}
```

+++

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of deploying your Zola site onto the [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com). Zeabur provides a seamless deployment experience, with automatic SSL certificates and global-edge network delivery. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- A Zola site project on your local machine.
- A GitHub account and your Zola site project repository hosted on GitHub.
- A Zeabur account. If you don't have one, sign up at [here](https://zeabur.com/login).

## Step 1: Create a Project on Zeabur

1. Log in to your Zeabur account.
2. Navigate to the dashboard and click on the **Create Project** button.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a new project.

## Step 2: Push Your Zola Files to GitHub

1. Initialize a Git repository in your Zola project folder if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

2. Push your Zola project to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Replace `<your-github-repo-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

## Step 3: Create a Service on Zeabur

1. Back in your Zeabur dashboard, click on **Create Service**.
2. Choose the **git** option to connect your GitHub repository.

## Step 4: Select Your Zola Repository

1. From the list of repositories, select the repository where your Zola project is located.

## Step 5: Automatic Deployment

Zeabur will automatically detect that you're deploying a Zola project and will handle the deployment process for you without any additional configuration needed.

To use a specific version of Zola, set [`ZOLA_VERSION`](https://zeabur.com/docs/environment/variables) environment variable in project settings to a valid
release tag, for example `0.17.2`.

## Step 6: Domain Binding

1. Once the deployment is complete, bind a domain name to your service.
2. You can choose to use a free `.zeabur.app` subdomain or bind your own custom domain.
3. Zeabur will automatically provide a free SSL certificate for your domain, ensuring secure browsing for your visitors.

## Step 7: Your Site is Live!

Congratulations! Your Zola site is now deployed and live, served through Zeabur's edge network. 

You can now visit your website at the domain you've set up.

Zola only has 4 commands: `init`, `build`, `serve` and `check`.

You can view the help for the whole program by running `zola --help` and
that for a specific command by running `zola <cmd> --help`.

## init

Creates the directory structure used by Zola at the given directory after asking a few basic configuration questions.
Any choices made during these prompts can be easily changed by modifying `config.toml`.

```bash
$ zola init my_site
$ zola init
```

If the `my_site` directory already exists, Zola will only populate it if it contains only hidden files (dotfiles are ignored). If no `my_site` argument is passed, Zola will try to populate the current directory.

In case you want to attempt to populate a non-empty directory and are brave, you can use `zola init --force`. Note that this will _not_ overwrite existing folders or files; in those cases you will get a `File exists (os error 17)` error or similar.

You can initialize a git repository and a Zola site directly from within a new folder:

```bash
$ git init
$ zola init
```

## build

This will build the whole site in the `public` directory (if this directory already exists, it is deleted).

```bash
$ zola build
```

You can override the config `base_url` by passing a new URL to the `base-url` flag.

```bash
$ zola build --base-url $DEPLOY_URL
```

This is useful for example when you want to deploy previews of a site to a dynamic URL, such as Netlify
deploy previews.

You can override the default output directory `public` by passing another value to the `output-dir` flag. If this directory already exists, the user will be prompted whether to replace the folder; you can override this prompt by passing the --force flag.

```bash
$ zola build --output-dir $DOCUMENT_ROOT
```

You can point to a config file other than `config.toml` like so (note that the position of the `config` option is important):

```bash
$ zola --config config.staging.toml build
```

You can also process a project from a different directory with the `root` flag. If building a project 'out-of-tree' with the `root` flag, you may want to combine it with the `output-dir` flag. (Note that like `config`, the position is important):
```bash
$ zola --root /path/to/project build
```

By default, drafts are not loaded. If you wish to include them, pass the `--drafts` flag.

## serve

This will build and serve the site using a local server. You can also specify
the interface/port combination to use if you want something different than the default (`127.0.0.1:1111`).

You can also specify different addresses for the interface and base_url using `--interface` and `-u`/`--base-url`, respectively, if for example you are running Zola in a Docker container.

> By default, devices from the local network **won't** be able to access the served pages. This may be of importance when you want to test page interaction and layout on your mobile device or tablet. If you set the interface to `0.0.0.0` however, devices from your local network will be able to access the served pages by requesting the local ip-address of the machine serving the pages and port used.
>
> In order to have everything work correctly, you might also have to alter the `base-url` flag to your local ip or set it to `/` to use server-base relative paths.

Use the `--open` flag to automatically open the locally hosted instance in your
web browser.

Before starting, Zola will delete the output directory (by default `public` in project root) to start from a clean slate.

If you are specifying the directory but are also using the `output-dir` flag, Zola will not use the specified directory if it already exists unless the --force flag is used.

```bash
$ zola serve
$ zola serve --port 2000
$ zola serve --interface 0.0.0.0
$ zola serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 2000
$ zola serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --base-url 127.0.0.1
$ zola serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --base-url /
$ zola serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 2000 --output-dir www/public
$ zola serve --open
```

The serve command will watch all your content and provide live reload without
a hard refresh if possible. If you are using WSL2 on Windows, make sure to store the website on the WSL file system.

Some changes cannot be handled automatically and thus live reload may not always work. If you
fail to see your change or get an error, try restarting `zola serve`.

You can also point to a config file other than `config.toml` like so (note that the position of the `config` option is important):

```bash
$ zola --config config.staging.toml serve
```

By default, drafts are not loaded. If you wish to include them, pass the `--drafts` flag.

## check

The check subcommand will try to build all pages just like the build command would, but without writing any of the
results to disk. Additionally, it will also check all external links in Markdown files by trying to fetch
them (links in the template files are not checked).

You can skip link checking for all the external links by `--skip-external-links` flag.

By default, drafts are not loaded. If you wish to include them, pass the `--drafts` flag.

## Colored output

Colored output is used if your terminal supports it.

*Note*: coloring is automatically disabled when the output is redirected to a pipe or a file (i.e., when the standard output is not a TTY).

You can disable this behavior by exporting one of the following two environment variables:

- `NO_COLOR` (the value does not matter)
- `CLICOLOR=0`

To force the use of colors, you can set the following environment variable:

- `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1`

The default configuration is sufficient to get Zola running locally but not more than that.
It follows the philosophy of paying for only what you need, almost everything is turned off by default.

To change the configuration, edit the `config.toml` file.
If you are not familiar with TOML, have a look at [the TOML spec](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).

⚠️ If you add keys to your `config.toml`, you must pay attention to which TOML section it belongs to. A TOML section starts with a header, e.g. `[search]`, and ends at the next section or EOF.

Here are the current `config.toml` sections:
1. main (unnamed)
2. markdown
3. link_checker
4. slugify
5. search
6. translations
7. languages
8. extra

**Only the `base_url` variable is mandatory**. Everything else is optional. All configuration variables
used by Zola as well as their default values are listed below:

```toml
# The base URL of the site; the only required configuration variable.
base_url = "https://mywebsite.com"

Zola uses the Sublime Text themes, making it very easy to add more.
If you want a theme not listed above, please open an issue or a pull request on the [Zola repo](https://github.com/getzola/zola).

Alternatively you can use the `extra_syntaxes_and_themes` configuration option to load your own custom themes from a .tmTheme file.
See [Syntax Highlighting](@/documentation/content/syntax-highlighting.md) for more details.

## Slugification strategies

By default, Zola will turn every path, taxonomies and anchors to a slug, an ASCII representation with no special characters.
You can however change that strategy for each kind of item, if you want UTF-8 characters in your URLs for example. There are 3 strategies:

- `on`: the default one, everything is turned into a slug
- `safe`: characters that cannot exist in files on Windows (`<>:"/\|?*`) or Unix (`/`) are removed, everything else stays
- `off`: nothing is changed, your site might not build on some OS and/or break various URL parsers

Since there are no filename issues with anchors, the `safe` and `off` strategies are identical in their case: the only change
is space being replaced by `_` since a space is not valid in an anchor.

Note that if you are using a strategy other than the default, you will have to manually escape whitespace and Markdown
tokens to be able to link to your pages. For example an internal link to a file named `some space.md` will need to be
written like `some%20space.md` in your Markdown files.

================
File: docs/content/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure.md
================
+++
title = "Directory structure"
weight = 30
+++

After running `zola init`, you should see the following structure in your directory:


```bash
.
├── config.toml
├── content
├── sass
├── static
├── templates
└── themes

5 directories, 1 file
```

You might also see a `public` directory if you are running the default `zola build/serve` commands which contains some output for the site: the full site for `zola build` and only the static assets for `zola serve`. This folder will be deleted/created automatically by `zola serve`.

Here's a high-level overview of each of these directories and `config.toml`.

## `config.toml`
A mandatory Zola configuration file in TOML format.
This file is explained in detail in the [configuration documentation](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md).

## `content`
Contains all your markup content (mostly `.md` files).
Each child directory of the `content` directory represents a [section](@/documentation/content/section.md)
that contains [pages](@/documentation/content/page.md) (your `.md` files).

To learn more, read the [content overview page](@/documentation/content/overview.md).

## `sass`
Contains the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) files to be compiled. Non-Sass files will be ignored.
The directory structure of the `sass` folder will be preserved when copying over the compiled files; for example, a file at
`sass/something/site.scss` will be compiled to `public/something/site.css`.

## `static`
Contains any kind of file. All the files/directories in the `static` directory will be copied as-is to the output directory.
If your static files are large, you can configure Zola to [hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) them
instead of copying them by setting `hard_link_static = true` in the config file.

## `templates`
Contains all the [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera) templates that will be used to render your site.
Have a look at the [templates documentation](@/documentation/templates/_index.md) to learn more about default templates
and available variables.

## `themes`
Contains themes that can be used for your site. If you are not planning to use themes, leave this directory empty.
If you want to learn about themes, see the [themes documentation](@/documentation/themes/_index.md).

  foo:
    steps:
      - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: zola@0.19.1
      # ...
```

See the action repo for docs and more examples.

### Docker

Zola is available on [the GitHub registry](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pkgs/container/zola).
It has no `latest` tag, you will need to specify a [specific version to pull](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pkgs/container/zola/versions).

```sh
$ docker pull ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.19.1
```

#### Build

```sh
$ docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v $PWD:/app --workdir /app ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.19.1 build
```

#### Serve

```sh
$ docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v $PWD:/app --workdir /app -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.19.1 serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --base-url localhost
```

You can now browse http://localhost:8080.

> To enable live browser reload, you may have to bind to port 1024. Zola searches for an open
> port between 1024 and 9000 for live reload. The new docker command would be
> `$ docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v $PWD:/app --workdir /app -p 8080:8080 -p 1024:1024 ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.19.1 serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --base-url localhost`

#### Multi-stage build

Since there is no shell in the Zola docker image, if you want to use it from inside a Dockerfile, you have to use the
exec form of `RUN`, like:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.19.1 as zola

COPY . /project
WORKDIR /project
RUN ["zola", "build"]
```

## Windows

Zola could be installed using official Winget command:

```sh
$ winget install getzola.zola
```

Also it is available on [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

```sh
$ scoop install zola
```

and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
$ choco install zola
```

Zola does not work in PowerShell ISE.

## From source

To build Zola from source, you will need to have Git, [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
installed.

From a terminal, you can now run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/getzola/zola.git
$ cd zola
$ cargo install --path . --locked
$ zola --version
```

If you encountered compilation errors like `error: failed to run custom build command for 'ring v0.16.20'`, you can try the command below instead:

```sh
$ cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features --features=native-tls
```

The binary will be available in the `target/release` directory. You can move it in your `$PATH` to have the
`zola` command available globally:

```sh
$ cp target/release/zola ~/.cargo/bin/zola
```

or in a directory if you want for example to have the binary in the same repository as the site.

## Zola at a Glance

Zola is a static site generator (SSG), similar to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (for a comprehensive list of SSGs, please see [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators)). It is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and uses the [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) template engine, which is similar to [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/), [Django templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/templates/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).

Content is written in [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Zola uses [pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark#pulldown-cmark) to parse markdown files. The goal of this library is 100% compliance with the CommonMark spec. It adds a few additional features such as parsing footnotes, Github flavored tables, Github flavored task lists and strikethrough.

SSGs use dynamic templates to transform content into static HTML pages. Static sites are thus very fast and require no databases, making them easy to host. A comparison between static and dynamic sites, such as WordPress, Drupal, and Django, can be found [here](https://dev.to/ashenmaster/static-vs-dynamic-sites-61f).

To get a taste of Zola, please see the quick overview below.

## First Steps with Zola

Unlike some SSGs, Zola makes no assumptions regarding the structure of your site. In this overview, we'll be making a simple blog site.

### Initialize Site

> This overview is based on Zola 0.19.1.

Please see the detailed [installation instructions for your platform](@/documentation/getting-started/installation.md). With Zola installed, let's initialize our site:

```
$ zola init myblog
```

You will be asked a few questions.

```
> What is the URL of your site? (https://example.com):
> Do you want to enable Sass compilation? [Y/n]:
> Do you want to enable syntax highlighting? [y/N]:
> Do you want to build a search index of the content? [y/N]:
```

 For our blog, let's accept the default values (i.e., press Enter for each question). We now have a `myblog` directory with the following structure:

```
├── config.toml
├── content
├── sass
├── static
├── templates
└── themes
```

For reference, by the **end** of this overview, our `myblog` directory will have the following structure:

```
├── config.toml
├── content/

Change directory into the newly-created `myblog` directory.

### Templates

We'll first create some templates to describe the structure of our site.

#### Home Page Template

Let's make a template for a home page. Create `templates/base.html` with the following content. This step will make more sense as we move through this overview.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>MyBlog</title>
</head>

<body>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      {% block content %} {% endblock content %}
    </div>
  </section>
</body>

</html>
```  

Now, let's create `templates/index.html` with the following content.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1 class="title">
  This is my blog made with Zola.
</h1>
{% endblock content %}
```  

This tells Zola that `index.html` extends our `base.html` file and replaces the block called "content" with the text between the `{% block content %}` and `{% endblock content %}` tags.

#### Blog Template

To create a template for a page that lists all blog posts, create `templates/blog.html` with the following content.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1 class="title">
  {{ section.title }}
</h1>
<ul>
  <!-- If you are using pagination, section.pages will be empty.
       You need to use the paginator object -->  
  {% for page in section.pages %}
  <li><a href="{{ page.permalink | safe }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endblock content %}
```

As done by `index.html`, `blog.html` extends `base.html`, but in this template we want to list the blog posts. Here we also see expressions such as `{{ section.[...] }}` and `{{ page.[...] }}` which will be replaced with values from our [content](#content) when zola combines content with this template to render a page. In the list below the header, we loop through all the pages in our section (`blog` directory; more on this when we create content) and output each page title and URL using `{{ page.title }}` and `{{ page.permalink | safe }}`, respectively. We use the `| safe` filter because the permalink doesn't need to be HTML escaped (escaping would cause `/` to render as `&#x2F;`).

#### Blog Post Template

We have templates describing our home page and a page that lists all blog posts. Let's now create a template for an individual blog post. Create `templates/blog-page.html` with the following content.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1 class="title">
  {{ page.title }}
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>{{ page.date }}</strong></p>
{{ page.content | safe }}
{% endblock content %}
```

> Note the `| safe` filter for `{{ page.content }}`.

### Zola Live Reloading

Now that we've outlined our site's structure, let's start the Zola development server in the `myblog` directory.

```
$ zola serve
Building site...
Checking all internal links with anchors.
> Successfully checked 0 internal link(s) with anchors.
-> Creating 0 pages (0 orphan) and 0 sections
Done in 13ms.

Web server is available at http://127.0.0.1:1111

Listening for changes in .../myblog/{config.toml,content,sass,static,templates}
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

If you point your web browser to <http://127.0.0.1:1111>, you will see a message saying, "This is my blog made with Zola."

If you go to <http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/>, you will currently get a 404 which we will fix next.

### Content

We'll now create some content that Zola will use to generate site pages based on our templates.

#### Sections

We'll start by creating `content/blog/_index.md`. This file tells Zola that `blog` is a [section](@/documentation/content/section.md), which is how content is categorized in Zola. In the `_index.md` file, we'll set the following variables in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format:

```md
+++
title = "List of blog posts"
sort_by = "date"
template = "blog.html"
page_template = "blog-page.html"
+++
```

> Note that although no variables are mandatory, the opening and closing `+++` are required.

* *sort_by = "date"* tells Zola to use the date to order our section pages (more on pages below). 
* *template = "blog.html"* tells Zola to use `templates/blog.html` as the template for listing the Markdown files in this section. 
* *page_template = "blog-page.html"* tells Zola to use `templates/blog-page.html` as the template for individual Markdown files. 

For a full list of section variables, please see the [section](@/documentation/content/section.md) documentation.

The value of our `title` variable here is available to templates such as `blog.html` as `{{ section.title }}`.

If you now go to <http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/>, you will see an empty list of posts.

#### Markdown

We'll now create some blog posts. Create `content/blog/first.md` with the following content.

```md
+++
title = "My first post"
date = 2019-11-27
+++

This is my first blog post.
```

The *title* and *date* will be available to us in the `blog-page.html` template as `{{ page.title }}` and `{{ page.date }}`, respectively. All text below the closing `+++` will be available to templates as `{{ page.content }}`.

If you now go back to our blog list page at <http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/>, you should see our lonely post. Let's add another. Create `content/blog/second.md` with the contents:

```md
+++
title = "My second post"
date = 2019-11-28
+++

This is my second blog post.
```

Back at <http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/>, our second post shows up on top of the list because it's newer than the first post and we had set *sort_by = "date"* in our `_index.md` file.

As a final step, let's modify `templates/index.html` (our home page) to link to our list of blog posts:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1 class="title">
  This is my blog made with Zola.
</h1>
<p><a href="{{/* get_url(path='@/blog/_index.md') */}}">Posts</a>.</p>
{% endblock content %}
```  

This has been a quick overview of Zola. You can now dive into the rest of the documentation.

================
File: docs/content/documentation/templates/feeds/index.md
================
+++
title = "Feeds"
weight = 50
aliases = ["/documentation/templates/rss/"]
+++

If the site `config.toml` file sets `generate_feeds = true`, then Zola will
generate feed files for the site, named according to the `feed_filenames`
setting in `config.toml`, which defaults to `atom.xml`. Given the feed filename
`atom.xml`, the generated file will live at `base_url/atom.xml`, based upon the
`atom.xml` file in the `templates` directory, or the built-in Atom template.

`feed_filenames` can be set to any value, but built-in templates are provided
for `atom.xml` (in the preferred Atom 1.0 format), and `rss.xml` (in the RSS
2.0 format). If you choose a different filename (e.g. `feed.xml`), you will
need to provide a template yourself.

In case you want to extend, or modify, the built-in templates, you can get a
copy from [the source code here](https://github.com/getzola/zola/tree/master/components/templates/src/builtins)
and place it in the `templates/` directory with the appropriate name. You can
check the documentation for the specifications for Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0 in
[W3C Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/).

**Only pages with a date will be available.**

The author in the feed is set as
- The first author in `authors` set in the 
  [front matter](@/documentation/content/page.md#front-matter)
- If that is not present it falls back to the `author` in the 
  [Configuration](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md)
- If that is also not preset it is set to `Unknown`.

Note that `atom.xml` and `rss.xml` require different formats for specifying the
author. According to [RFC 4287][atom_rfc] `atom.xml` requires the author's
name, for example `"John Doe"`. While according to the 
[RSS 2.0 Specification][rss_spec] the email address is required, and the name
optionally included, for example `"lawyer@boyer.net"` or 
`"lawyer@boyer.net (Lawyer Boyer)"`.

The feed template gets five variables:

- `config`: the site config
- `feed_url`: the full url to that specific feed
- `last_updated`: the most recent `updated` or `date` field of any post
- `pages`: see [page variables](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md#page-variables)
  for a detailed description of what this contains
- `lang`: the language code that applies to all of the pages in the feed,
  if the site is multilingual, or `config.default_language` if it is not

Feeds for taxonomy terms get two more variables, using types from the
[taxonomies templates](@/documentation/templates/taxonomies.md):

- `taxonomy`: of type `TaxonomyConfig`
- `term`: of type `TaxonomyTerm`, but without `term.pages` (use `pages` instead)

You can also enable separate feeds for each section by setting the
`generate_feeds` variable to true in the respective section's front matter.
Section feeds will use the same template as indicated in the `config.toml` file.
Section feeds, in addition to the five feed template variables, get the
`section` variable from the [section
template](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md).

Enable feed autodiscovery allows feed readers and browsers to notify user about a RSS or Atom feed available on your web site. So it is easier for user to subscribe.
As an example this is how it looks like using [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox) [Livemarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livemarks/?src=search) addon.

![RSS feed autodiscovery example.](rss_feed.png)

You can enable posts autodiscovery modifying your blog `base.html` template adding the following code in between the `<head>` tags.
```html
{% block rss %}
  <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="{{/* get_url(path="rss.xml", trailing_slash=false) */}}">
{% endblock %}
```
You can as well use an Atom feed using `type="application/atom+xml"` and `path="atom.xml"`.

All pages on your site will refer to your post feed.

In order to enable the tag feeds as well, you can overload the `block rss` using the following code in your `tags/single.html` template.
```html
{% block rss %}
  {% set rss_path = "tags/" ~ term.name ~ "/rss.xml" %}
  <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="{{/* get_url(path=rss_path, trailing_slash=false) */}}">
{% endblock rss %}
```
Each tag page will refer to it's dedicated feed.

File: docs/content/documentation/templates/_index.md

title = "Templates"
weight = 3
sort_by = "weight"

redirect_to = "documentation/templates/overview"
+++

================
File: docs/content/documentation/templates/404.md
================
+++
title = "404 error page"
weight = 80
+++

Zola will look for a `404.html` file in the `templates` directory or
use the built-in one. The default template is very basic and gets `config` in its context.

================
File: docs/content/documentation/templates/archive.md
================
+++
title = "Archive"
weight = 90
+++

Zola doesn't have a built-in way to display an archive page (a page showing
all post titles ordered by year). However, this can be accomplished directly in the templates:

```jinja2
{% for year, posts in section.pages | group_by(attribute="year") %}
    <h2>{{ year }}</h2>

    <ul>
    {% for post in posts %}
        <li><a href="{{ post.permalink }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endfor %}
```

This snippet assumes that posts are sorted by date and that you want to display the archive
in descending order. If you want to show articles in ascending order, you need to further
process the list of pages:
```jinja2
{% set posts_by_year = section.pages | group_by(attribute="year") %}
{% set_global years = [] %}
{% for year, ignored in posts_by_year %}
    {% set_global years = years | concat(with=year) %}
{% endfor %}
{% for year in years | reverse %}
    {% set posts = posts_by_year[year] %}
    {# (same as the previous snippet) #}
{% endfor %}
```

File: docs/content/documentation/templates/overview.md
================
+++
title = "Overview"
weight = 10
+++

Zola uses the [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera) template engine, which is very similar
to Jinja2, Liquid and Twig.

As this documentation will only talk about how templates work in Zola, please read
the [Tera template documentation](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#templates) if you want
to learn more about it first.

All templates live in the `templates` directory.  If you are not sure what variables are available in a template,
you can place `{{ __tera_context }}` in the template to print the whole context.

A few variables are available on all templates except feeds and the sitemap:

- `config`: the language aware [configuration](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md)
- `current_path`: the path (full URL without `base_url`) of the current page, always starting with a `/`
- `current_url`: the full URL for the current page
- `lang`: the language for the current page

Config variables can be accessed like `config.variable`, in HTML for example with `{{ config.base_url }}`.
The 404 template does not get `current_path` and `current_url` (this information cannot be determined).

On top of the `config` attributes mentioned above, it also gets `config.mode` which is whether it's run in `build`, `serve` or `check`.

## Standard templates
By default, Zola will look for three templates: `index.html`, which is applied
to the site homepage; `section.html`, which is applied to all sections (any HTML
page generated by creating a directory within your `content` directory); and
`page.html`, which is applied to all pages (any HTML page generated by creating an
`.md` file within your `content` directory).

The homepage is always a section (regardless of whether it contains other pages).
Thus, the `index.html` and `section.html` templates both have access to the
section variables.  The `page.html` template has access to the page variables.
The page and section variables are described in more detail in the next section.

## Built-in templates
Zola comes with four built-in templates: `atom.xml` and `rss.xml` (described in
[Feeds](@/documentation/templates/feeds/index.md)), `sitemap.xml` (described in [Sitemap](@/documentation/templates/sitemap.md)),
and `robots.txt` (described in [Robots.txt](@/documentation/templates/robots.md)).
Additionally, themes can add their own templates, which will be applied if not
overridden.  You can override built-in or theme templates by creating a template with
the same name in the correct path. For example, you can override the Atom template by
creating a `templates/atom.xml` file.

## Custom templates
In addition to the standard `index.html`, `section.html` and `page.html` templates,
you may also create custom templates by creating an `.html` file in the `templates`
directory.  These custom templates will not be used by default.  Instead, a custom template will _only_ be used if you apply it by setting the `template` front-matter variable to the path for that template (or if you `include` it in another template that is applied).  For example, if you created a custom template for your site's About page called `about.html`, you could apply it to your `about.md` page by including the following front matter in your `about.md` page:

```md
+++
title = "About Us"
template = "about.html"
+++
```

Custom templates are not required to live at the root of your `templates` directory.
For example, `product_pages/with_pictures.html` is a valid template.

## Built-in filters
Zola adds a few filters in addition to [those](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#filters) already present
in Tera.

### markdown
Converts the given variable to HTML using Markdown. There are a few differences compared to page/section Markdown rendering:

- shortcodes evaluated by this filter cannot access the current rendering context: `config` will be available, but accessing `section` or `page` (among others) from a shortcode called within the `markdown` filter will prevent your site from building (see [this discussion](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pull/1358))
- `lang` in shortcodes will always be equal to the site's `config.default_language` (or `en` otherwise) ; it should not be a problem, but if it is in most cases, but if you need to use language-aware shortcodes in this filter, please refer to the [Shortcode context](@/documentation/content/shortcodes.md#shortcode-context) section of the docs.

By default, the filter will wrap all text in a paragraph. To disable this behaviour, you can
pass `true` to the inline argument:

```jinja2
{{ some_text | markdown(inline=true) }}
```

You do not need to use this filter with `page.content` or `section.content`, the content is already rendered.

### base64_encode
Encode the variable to base64.

### base64_decode
Decode the variable from base64.

### regex_replace
Replace text via regular expressions.

```jinja2
{{ "World Hello" | regex_replace(pattern=`(?P<subject>\w+), (?P<greeting>\w+)`, rep=`$greeting $subject`) }}
<!-- Hello World -->
```

### num_format
Format a number into its string representation.

```jinja2
{{ 1000000 | num_format }}
<!-- 1,000,000 -->
```

By default this will format the number using the locale set by `config.default_language` in config.toml.

To format a number for a specific locale, you can use the `locale` argument and pass the name of the desired locale:

```jinja2
{{ 1000000 | num_format(locale="en-IN") }}
<!-- 10,00,000 -->
```

## Built-in functions

Zola adds a few Tera functions to [those built-in in Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs#built-in-functions)
to make it easier to develop complex sites.

### File searching logic
For functions that are searching for a file on disk other than through `get_page` and `get_section`, the following
logic applies.

1. The base directory is the Zola root directory, where the `config.toml` is
2. For the given path: if it starts with `@/`, replace that with `content/` instead and trim any leading `/`
3. Search in the following locations in this order, returning the first where the file exists:
   1. `$base_directory` + `$path`
   2. `$base_directory` + `"static/"` + `$path`
   3. `$base_directory` + `"content/"` + `$path`
   4. `$base_directory` + `$output_path` + `$path`
   5. `$base_directory` + `"themes"` + `$theme` + `"static/"` + `$path` (only if using a theme)

In practice this means that `@/some/image.jpg`, `/content/some/image.jpg` and `content/some/image.jpg` will point to the
same thing.

It will error if the path is outside the Zola directory.

### `get_page`
Takes a path to an `.md` file and returns the associated page. The base path is the `content` directory.

```jinja2
{% set page = get_page(path="blog/page2.md") %}
```

If selecting a specific language for the page, you can pass `lang` with the language code to the function:

```jinja2
{% set page = get_page(path="blog/page2.md", lang="fr") %}

{# If "fr" is the default language, this is equivalent to #}
{% set page = get_page(path="blog/page2.md") %}

{# If "fr" is not the default language, this is equivalent to #}
{% set page = get_page(path="blog/page2.fr.md") %}
```

### `get_section`
Takes a path to an `_index.md` file and returns the associated section. The base path is the `content` directory.

```jinja2
{% set section = get_section(path="blog/_index.md") %}
```

If you only need the metadata of the section, you can pass `metadata_only=true` to the function:

```jinja2
{% set section = get_section(path="blog/_index.md", metadata_only=true) %}
```

If selecting a specific language for the section, you can pass `lang` with the language code to the function:

```jinja2
{% set section = get_section(path="blog/_index.md", lang="fr") %}

{# If "fr" is the default language, this is equivalent to #}
{% set section = get_section(path="blog/_index.md") %}

{# If "fr" is not the default language, this is equivalent to #}
{% set section = get_section(path="blog/_index.fr.md") %}
```

### `get_taxonomy_url`
Gets the permalink for the taxonomy item found.

```jinja2
{% set url = get_taxonomy_url(kind="categories", name=page.taxonomies.category, lang=page.lang) %}
```

`name` will almost always come from a variable but in case you want to do it manually,
the value should be the same as the one in the front matter, not the slugified version.

`lang` (optional) default to `config.default_language` in config.toml

`required` (optional) if a taxonomy is defined but there isn't any content that uses it then throw an error. Defaults to true.

### `get_taxonomy`
Gets the whole taxonomy of a specific kind.

```jinja2
{% set categories = get_taxonomy(kind="categories") %}
```

The type of the output is:

```ts
kind: TaxonomyConfig;
items: Array<TaxonomyTerm>;
lang: String;
permalink: String;
```

`lang` (optional) default to `config.default_language` in config.toml

`required` (optional) if a taxonomy is defined but there isn't any content that uses it then throw an error. Defaults to true.

See the [Taxonomies documentation](@/documentation/templates/taxonomies.md) for a full documentation of those types.

### `get_taxonomy_term`
Gets a single term from a taxonomy of a specific kind.

```jinja2
{% set categories = get_taxonomy_term(kind="categories", term="term_name") %}
```

The type of the output is a single `TaxonomyTerm` item.

`lang` (optional) default to `config.default_language` in config.toml

`include_pages` (optional) default to true. If false, the `pages` item in the `TaxonomyTerm` will be empty, regardless of what pages may actually exist for this term. `page_count` will correctly reflect the number of pages for this term in both cases.

`required` (optional) if a taxonomy or term is not found`.

See the [Taxonomies documentation](@/documentation/templates/taxonomies.md) for a full documentation of those types.

### `get_url`
Gets the permalink for the given path.
If the path starts with `@/`, it will be treated as an [internal link](@/documentation/content/linking.md#internal-links) to a Markdown file, 
starting from the root `content` directory as well as validated.

```jinja2
{% set url = get_url(path="@/blog/_index.md") %}
```

It accepts an optional parameter `lang` in order to compute a *language-aware URL* in multilingual websites. Assuming `config.base_url` is `"http://example.com"`, the following snippet will:

- return `"http://example.com/blog/"` if `config.default_language` is `"en"`
- return `"http://example.com/en/blog/"` if `config.default_language` is **not** `"en"` and `"en"` appears in `config.languages`
- fail otherwise, with the error message `"'en' is not an authorized language (check config.languages)."`

```jinja2
{% set url = get_url(path="@/blog/_index.md", lang="en") %}
```

This can also be used to get the permalink for a static file, for example if
you want to link to the file that is located at `static/css/app.css`:

```jinja2
{{/* get_url(path="css/app.css") */}}
```

By default, the link will not have a trailing slash. You can force one by passing `trailing_slash=true` to the `get_url` function.
An example is:

```jinja2
{{/* get_url(path="css/app.css", trailing_slash=true) */}}
```

In the case of a non-internal link, you can also add a cachebust of the format `?h=<sha256>` at the end of a URL
by passing `cachebust=true` to the `get_url` function. In this case, the path will need to resolve to an actual file. 
See [File Searching Logic](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#file-searching-logic) for details.

### `get_hash`

Returns the hash digest (SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512) of a file or a string literal.

It can take the following arguments:
- `path`: mandatory, see [File Searching Logic](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#file-searching-logic) for details
- **or** `literal`: mandatory, the string value to be hashed
- `sha_type`: optional, one of `256`, `384` or `512`, defaults to `384`
- `base64`: optional, `true` or `false`, defaults to `true`. Whether to encode the hash as base64

Either `path` or `literal` must be given.

```jinja2
{{/* get_hash(literal="Hello World", sha_type=256) */}}
{{/* get_hash(path="static/js/app.js", sha_type=256) */}}
```

The function can also output a base64-encoded hash value when its `base64`
parameter is set to `true`. This can be used to implement [subresource
integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).

```jinja2
<script src="{{/* get_url(path="static/js/app.js") */}}"
  integrity="sha384-{{ get_hash(path="static/js/app.js", sha_type=384, base64=true) | safe }}"></script>
```

Do note that subresource integrity is typically used when using external scripts, which `get_hash` does not support.

### `get_image_metadata`

Gets metadata for an image. This supports common formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, BMP, GIF as well as SVG.

It can take the following arguments:

- `path`: mandatory, see [File Searching Logic](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#file-searching-logic) for details
- `allow_missing`: optional, `true` or `false`, defaults to `false`. Whether a missing file should raise an error or not.

The method returns a map containing `width`, `height`, `format`, and `mime`. The `format` returned is the most common file extension for the file format, which may not match the one used for the image.

```jinja2
  {% set meta = get_image_metadata(path="...") %}
  Our image (.{{meta.format}}) has format is {{ meta.width }}x{{ meta.height }}
```

### `load_data`

Loads data from a file, URL, or string literal. Supported file types include *toml*, *json*, *csv*, *bibtex*, *yaml*/*yml*, 
and *xml* and only supports UTF-8 encoding.

Any other file type will be loaded as plain text.

The `path` argument specifies the path to a local data file, according to the [File Searching Logic](@/documentation/templates/overview.md#file-searching-logic).

```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(path="content/blog/story/data.toml") %}
```

Alternatively, the `url` argument specifies the location of a remote URL to load.

```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_of_Paris") %}
```

Alternatively, the `literal` argument specifies an object literal. Note: if the `format` argument is not specified, then plain text will be what is assumed.

```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(literal='{"name": "bob"}', format="json") %}
{{ data["name"] }}
```

*Note: the `required` parameter has no effect when used in combination with the `literal` argument.*

The optional `required` boolean argument can be set to false so that missing data (HTTP error or local file not found) does not produce an error, but returns a null value instead. However, permission issues with a local file and invalid data that could not be parsed to the requested data format will still produce an error even with `required=false`.

The snippet below outputs the HTML from a Wikipedia page, or "No data found" if the page was not reachable, or did not return a successful HTTP code:

```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_of_Paris", required=false) %}
{% if data %}{{ data | safe }}{% else %}No data found{% endif %}
```

The optional `format` argument allows you to specify and override which data type is contained within the specified file or URL.
Valid entries are `toml`, `json`, `csv`, `bibtex`, `yaml`, `xml` or `plain`. If the `format` argument isn't specified, then the 
path extension is used. In the case of a literal, `plain` is assumed if `format` is unspecified.


```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(path="content/blog/story/data.txt", format="json") %}
```

Use the `plain` format for when your file has a supported extension but you want to load it as plain text.

For *toml*, *json*, *yaml* and *xml*, the data is loaded into a structure matching the original data file;
however, for *csv* there is no native notion of such a structure. Instead, the data is separated
into a data structure containing *headers* and *records*. See the example below to see
how this works.

In the template:
```jinja2
{% set data = load_data(path="content/blog/story/data.csv") %}
```

In the *content/blog/story/data.csv* file:
```csv
Number, Title
1,Gutenberg
2,Printing
```

The equivalent json value of the parsed data would be stored in the `data` variable in the
template:
```json
{
    "headers": ["Number", "Title"],
    "records": [
        ["1", "Gutenberg"],
        ["2", "Printing"]
    ],
}
```

The `bibtex` format loads data into a structure matching the format used by the
[nom-bibtex crate](https://crates.io/crates/nom-bibtex). The following is an example of data
in bibtex format:

```
@preamble{"A bibtex preamble" # " this is."}

@Comment{
    Here is a comment.
}

Another comment!

@string(name = "Vincent Prouillet")
@string(github = "https://github.com/getzola/zola")

@misc {my_citation_key,
    author= name,
    title = "Zola",
    note = "github: " # github
}                                                    }
```

The following is the json-equivalent format of the produced bibtex data structure:
```json
{
    "preambles": ["A bibtex preamble this is."],
    "comments": ["Here is a comment.", "Another comment!"],
    "variables": {
        "name": "Vincent Prouillet",
        "github": "https://github.com/getzola/zola"
    },
    "bibliographies": [
        {
            "entry_type": "misc",
            "citation_key": "my_citation_key",
            "tags": {
                "author": "Vincent Prouillet",
                "title": "Zola",
                "note": "github: https://github.com/getzola/zola"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Finally, the bibtex data can be accessed from the template as follows:
```jinja2
{% set tags = data.bibliographies[0].tags %}
This was generated using {{ tags.title }}, authored by {{ tags.author }}.
```

#### Remote content

Instead of using a file, you can load data from a remote URL. This can be done by specifying a `url` parameter
to `load_data` rather than `path`.

```jinja2
{% set response = load_data(url="https://api.github.com/repos/getzola/zola") %}
{{ response }}
```

By default, the response body will be returned with no parsing. This can be changed by using the `format` argument
as below.


```jinja2
{% set response = load_data(url="https://api.github.com/repos/getzola/zola", format="json") %}
{{ response }}
```

When no other parameters are specified the URL will always be retrieved using a HTTP GET request.
Using the parameter `method`, since version 0.14.0, you can also choose to retrieve the URL using a POST request.

When using `method="POST"` you can also use the parameters `body` and `content_type`.
The parameter body is the actual contents sent in the POST request.
The parameter `content_type` should be the mimetype of the body.

This example will make a POST request to the kroki service to generate a SVG.

```jinja2
{% set postdata = load_data(url="https://kroki.io/blockdiag/svg", format="plain", method="POST" ,content_type="text/plain", body="blockdiag {
  'Doing POST' -> 'using load_data'
  'using load_data' -> 'can generate' -> 'block diagrams';
  'using load_data' -> is -> 'very easy!';

  'Doing POST' [color = 'greenyellow'];
  'block diagrams' [color = 'pink'];
  'very easy!' [color = 'orange'];
}")%}
{{postdata|safe}}
```

If you need additional handling for the HTTP headers, you can use the `headers` parameter.
You might need this parameter when the resource requires authentication or require passing additional
parameters via special headers.
Please note that the headers will be appended to the default headers set by Zola itself instead of replacing them.

This example will make a POST request to the GitHub markdown rendering service.

```jinja2
{% set postdata = load_data(url="https://api.github.com/markdown", format="plain", method="POST", content_type="application/json", headers=["accept=application/vnd.github.v3+json"], body='{"text":"headers support added in #1710, commit before it: b3918f124d13ec1bedad4860c15a060dd3751368","context":"getzola/zola","mode":"gfm"}')%}
{{postdata|safe}}
```

The following example shows how to send a GraphQL query to GitHub (requires authentication).
If you want to try this example on your own machine, you need to provide a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token),
you can acquire the access token at this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens and then set `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable to the access token you have obtained.

```jinja2
{% set token = get_env(name="GITHUB_TOKEN") %}
{% set postdata = load_data(url="https://api.github.com/graphql", format="json", method="POST" ,content_type="application/json", headers=["accept=application/vnd.github.v4.idl", "authorization=Bearer " ~ token], body='{"query":"query { viewer { login }}"}')%}
{{postdata|safe}}
```

In case you need to specify multiple headers with the same name, you can specify them like this:

```
headers=["accept=application/json,text/html"]
```

Which is equivalent to two `Accept` headers with `application/json` and `text/html`.

If it doesn't work, you can instead specify the headers multiple times to achieve a similar effect:

```
headers=["accept=application/json", "accept=text/html"]
```

#### Data caching

Data file loading and remote requests are cached in memory during the build, so multiple requests aren't made
to the same endpoint.
URLs are cached based on the URL, and data files are cached based on the file modified time.
The format is also taken into account when caching, so a request will be sent twice if it's loaded with two
different formats.

### `trans`
Gets the translation of the given `key`, for the `default_language`, the `lang`uage given or the active language:

```jinja2
{{/* trans(key="title") */}}
{{/* trans(key="title", lang="fr") */}}
{{/* trans(key="title", lang=lang) */}}
```

### `resize_image`
Resizes an image file.
Please refer to [_Content / Image Processing_](@/documentation/content/image-processing/index.md) for complete documentation.

Templates for pages and sections are very similar.

## Page variables
Zola will try to load the `templates/page.html` template, the `page.html` template of the theme if one is used
or render the built-in template (a blank page).

Whichever template you decide to render, you will get a `page` variable in your template
with the following fields:


```ts
// The HTML output of the Markdown content
content: String;
title: String?;
description: String?;
date: String?;
updated: String?;
slug: String;
path: String;
authors: Array<String>;
draft: Bool;
// the path, split on '/'
components: Array<String>;
permalink: String;
summary: String?;
taxonomies: HashMap<String, Array<String>>;
extra: HashMap<String, Any>;
toc: Array<Header>,
// Naive word count, will not work for languages without whitespace
word_count: Number;
// Based on https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214991667-Read-time
reading_time: Number;
// earlier / lighter
lower: Page?;
// later / heavier
higher: Page?;
// Year/month/day is only set if the page has a date and month/day are 1-indexed
year: Number?;
month: Number?;
day: Number?;
// Paths of colocated assets, relative to the content directory
assets: Array<String>;
// The relative paths of the parent sections until the index one, for use with the `get_section` Tera function
// The first item is the index section and the last one is the parent section
// This is filled after rendering a page content so it will be empty in shortcodes
ancestors: Array<String>;
// The relative path from the `content` directory to the markdown file
relative_path: String;
// The relative path from the `content` directory to the directory of a colocated index.md markdown file
// Null if the file is not colocated.
colocated_path: String?;
// The language for the page if there is one. Default to the config `default_language`
lang: String;
// Information about all the available languages for that content, including the current page
translations: Array<TranslatedContent>;
// All the pages/sections linking this page: their permalink and a title if there is one
backlinks: Array<{permalink: String, title: String?}>;
```

## Section variables
By default, Zola will try to load `templates/index.html` for `content/_index.md`
and `templates/section.html` for other `_index.md` files. If there isn't
one, it will render the built-in template (a blank page).

Whichever template you decide to render, you will get a `section` variable in your template
with the following fields:


```ts
// The HTML output of the Markdown content
content: String;
title: String?;
description: String?;
path: String;
// the path, split on '/'
components: Array<String>;
permalink: String;
extra: HashMap<String, Any>;
// Pages directly in this section. By default, the pages are not sorted. Please set the "sort_by"
// variable in the _index.md file of the corresponding section to "date" or "weight" for sorting by
// date and weight, respectively.
pages: Array<Page>;
// Direct subsections to this section, sorted by subsections weight
// This only contains the path to use in the `get_section` built-in function to get
// the actual section object if you need it
subsections: Array<String>;
toc: Array<Header>,
// Unicode word count
word_count: Number;
// Based on https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214991667-Read-time
reading_time: Number;
// Paths of colocated assets, relative to the content directory
assets: Array<String>;
// The relative paths of the parent sections until the index one, for use with the `get_section` Tera function
// The first item is the index section and the last one is the parent section
// This is filled after rendering a page content so it will be empty in shortcodes
ancestors: Array<String>;
// The relative path from the `content` directory to the markdown file
relative_path: String;
// The language for the section if there is one. Default to the config `default_language`
lang: String;
// Information about all the available languages for that content
translations: Array<TranslatedContent>;
// All the pages/sections linking this page: their permalink and a title if there is one
backlinks: Array<{permalink: String, title: String?}>;
// Whether this section generates feeds or not. Taken from the front-matter if set
generate_feeds: bool;
// Whether this section is transparent. Taken from the front-matter if set
transparent: bool;
// How many items per pager (if defined)
paginate_by: Number?;
// If items order is reversed in the pagination (defaults to false)
paginate_reversed: bool;
```

Information about pagination is useful when using the `get_section` Tera function for which the `paginator` is not available.

See [pagination template documentation](@/documentation/templates/pagination.md) for more information on the `paginator` variable.

## Table of contents

Both page and section templates have a `toc` variable that corresponds to an array of `Header`.
A `Header` has the following fields:

```ts
// The hX level
level: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;
// The generated slug id
id: String;
// The text of the header
title: String;
// A link pointing directly to the header, using the inserted anchor
permalink: String;
// All lower level headers below this header
children: Array<Header>;
```

## Translated content

Both pages and sections have a `translations` field that corresponds to an array of `TranslatedContent`. If your
site is not using multiple languages, this will always be an empty array.
`TranslatedContent` has the following fields:

```ts
// The language code for that content, empty if it is the default language
lang: String?;
// The title of that content if there is one
title: String?;
// A permalink to that content
permalink: String;
// The path to the markdown file; useful for retrieving the full page through
// the `get_page` function.
path: String;
```

Two things can get paginated: a section and a taxonomy term.

Both kinds get a `paginator` variable of the `Pager` type, on top of the common variables mentioned in the
[overview page](@/documentation/templates/overview.md):

```ts
// How many items per pager
paginate_by: Number;
// The base URL for the pagination: section permalink + pagination path
// You can concatenate an integer with that to get a link to a given pagination pager.
base_url: String;
// How many pagers in total
number_pagers: Number;
// Permalink to the first pager
first: String;
// Permalink to the last pager
last: String;
// Permalink to the previous pager, if there is one
previous: String?;
// Permalink to the next pager, if there is one
next: String?;
// All pages for the current pager
pages: Array<Page>;
// Which pager are we on, 1-indexed
current_index: Number;
// Total number of pages across all the pagers
total_pages: Number;
```

**The variable will not be defined if `paginate_by` is not set to a positive number.**

A pager is a page of the pagination; if you have 100 pages and paginate_by is set to 10, you will have 10 pagers each
containing 10 pages.

## Section

A paginated section gets the same `section` variable as a normal
[section page](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md#section-variables)
minus its pages. The pages are instead in `paginator.pages`.

## Taxonomy term

A paginated taxonomy gets two variables aside from the `paginator` variable:

- a `taxonomy` variable of type `TaxonomyConfig`
- a `term` variable of type `TaxonomyTerm`.

See the [taxonomies page](@/documentation/templates/taxonomies.md) for a detailed version of the types.

## SEO

It is preferable to not include paginated pages in sitemap since they are non-canonical pages.
To exclude paginated pages in sitemap, set the
`exclude_paginated_pages_in_sitemap` as `all` in `config.toml`.

## Example

Here is an example from a theme on how to use pagination on a page (`index.html` in this case):

```jinja2
<div class="posts">
    {% for page in paginator.pages %}
        <article class="post">
            {{ post_macros::title(page=page) }}
            <div class="post__summary">
                {{ page.summary | safe }}
            </div>
            <div class="read-more">
                <a href="{{ page.permalink }}">Read more...</a>
            </div>
        </article>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
<nav class="pagination">
    {% if paginator.previous %}
        <a class="previous" href="{{ paginator.previous }}">‹ Previous</a>
    {% endif %}
    {% if paginator.next %}
        <a class="next" href="{{ paginator.next }}">Next ›</a>
    {% endif %}
</nav>
```

================
File: docs/content/documentation/templates/robots.md
================
+++
title = "Robots.txt"
weight = 70
+++

Zola will look for a `robots.txt` file in the `templates` directory or
use the built-in one.

Robots.txt is the simplest of all templates: it only gets `config`
and the default is what most sites want:

```jinja2
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Allow: /
Sitemap: {{/* get_url(path="sitemap.xml") */}}
```

The file can be extended & expanded like other templates using e.g. Tera's `include` tag:

```jinja2
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Allow: /
Sitemap: {{/* get_url(path="sitemap.xml") */}}

{% include "path/to/other/robots.txt" %}
```

================
File: docs/content/documentation/templates/sitemap.md
================
+++
title = "Sitemap"
weight = 60
+++

Zola will look for a `sitemap.xml` file in the `templates` directory or
use the built-in one.

If your site has more than 30 000 pages, it will automatically split
the links into multiple sitemaps, as recommended by [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en):

> All formats limit a single sitemap to 50MB (uncompressed) and 50,000 URLs. 
> If you have a larger file or more URLs, you will have to break your list into multiple sitemaps. 
> You can optionally create a sitemap index file (a file that points to a list of sitemaps) and submit
> that single index file to Google.

In such a case, Zola will use a template called `split_sitemap_index.xml` to render the index sitemap.


The `sitemap.xml` template gets a single variable:

- `entries`: all pages of the site, as a list of `SitemapEntry`

A `SitemapEntry` has the following fields:

```ts
permalink: String;
updated: String?;
extra: Hashmap<String, Any>?;
```

The `split_sitemap_index.xml` also gets a single variable:

- `sitemaps`: a list of permalinks to the sitemaps

================
File: docs/content/documentation/templates/taxonomies.md
================
+++
title = "Taxonomies"
weight = 40
+++

Zola will look up the following, taxon-specific files in the `templates` directory:

- `$TAXONOMY_NAME/single.html`
- `$TAXONOMY_NAME/list.html`

if they are not found, it will attempt to fall back on the following generic template files:
- `taxonomy_single.html`
- `taxonomy_list.html`

The taxonomy templates are required only if at least one taxonomy exists with `render` set to `true`.

First, `TaxonomyTerm` has the following fields:

```ts
name: String;
slug: String;
path: String;
permalink: String;
pages: Array<Page>;
page_count: Number;
```

and `TaxonomyConfig` has the following fields:

```ts
name: String,
paginate_by: Number?;
paginate_path: String?;
feed: Bool;
render: Bool;
```


### Taxonomy list (`list.html`)

This template is never paginated and therefore gets the following variables in all cases.

```ts
// The site config
config: Config;
// The data of the taxonomy, from the config
taxonomy: TaxonomyConfig;
// The current full permalink for that page
current_url: String;
// The current path for that page
current_path: String;
// All terms for that taxonomy
terms: Array<TaxonomyTerm>;
// The lang of the current page
lang: String;
```


### Single term (`single.html`)
```ts
// The site config
config: Config;
// The data of the taxonomy, from the config
taxonomy: TaxonomyConfig;
// The current full permalink for that page
current_url: String;
// The current path for that page
current_path: String;
// The current term being rendered
term: TaxonomyTerm;
// The lang of the current page
lang: String;
```

A paginated taxonomy term will also get a `paginator` variable; see the
[pagination page](@/documentation/templates/pagination.md) for more details.

Creating a theme is exactly like creating a normal site with Zola, except you
will want to use many [Tera blocks](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs#inheritance) to
allow users to easily modify it.

## Getting started
As mentioned, a theme is just like any site; start by running `zola init MY_THEME_NAME`.

The only thing needed to turn that site into a theme is to add a `theme.toml` configuration file with the
following fields:

```toml
name = "my theme name"
description = "A classic blog theme"
# An optional tags to allow quick search
tags = []
license = "MIT"
homepage = "https://github.com/getzola/hyde"
# The minimum version of Zola required
min_version = "0.4.0"
# An optional live demo URL
demo = ""

# Any variable there can be overridden in the end user `config.toml`
# You don't need to prefix variables by the theme name but as this will
# be merged with user data, some kind of prefix or nesting is preferable
# Use snake_casing to be consistent with the rest of Zola
[extra]

# The theme author info: you!
[author]
name = "Vincent Prouillet"
homepage = "https://vincent.is"

# If this is porting a theme from another static site engine, provide
# the info of the original author here
[original]
author =  "mdo"
homepage = "https://markdotto.com/"
repo = "https://www.github.com/mdo/hyde"
```

A simple theme you can use as an example is [Hyde](https://github.com/Keats/hyde).

## Working on a theme
As a theme is just a site, you can simply use `zola serve` and make changes to your
theme, with live reload working as expected.

Make sure to commit every directory (including `content`) in order for other people
to be able to build the theme from your repository.

## Submitting a theme to the gallery

If you want your theme to be featured in the [themes](@/themes/_index.md) section
of this site, make sure that the theme meets the following three requirements:

- have a `screenshot.png` of the theme in action with a max size of around 2000x1000
- have a thorough `README.md` explaining how to use the theme and any other information
of importance
- be of reasonably high quality

When your theme is ready, you can submit it to the [themes repository](https://github.com/getzola/themes)
by following the process in the README.

title = "Customizing a theme"

+++

When your site uses a theme, you can replace parts of it in your site's templates folder. For any given theme template, you can either override a single block in it, or replace the whole template. If a site template and a theme template collide, the site template will be given priority. Whether a theme template collides or not, theme templates remain accessible from any template within `theme_name/templates/`.

## Replacing a template

When your site uses a theme, the generated structure follows the theme's structure whenever possible, i.e. there are no user defined templates with the same name and relative path as the theme's; for example: with two files `templates/page.html` and `themes/theme_name/templates/page.html`, the site template is the one that will be used. Such a conflict results in the theme's template being ignored in favor of the template defined by the user.  

## Overriding a block

If you don't want to replace a whole template, but override parts of it, you can [extend the template](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#inheritance) and redefine some specific blocks. For example, if you want to override the `title` block in your theme's page.html, you can create a page.html file in your site templates with the following content:

```
{% extends "theme_name/templates/page.html" %}
{% block title %}{{ page.title }}{% endblock %}
```

If you extend `page.html` and not `theme_name/templates/page.html` specifically, it will extend the site's page template if it exists, and the theme's page template otherwise. This makes it possible to override your theme's base template(s) from your site templates, as long as the theme templates do not hardcode the theme name in template paths. For instance, children templates in the theme should use `{% extends 'index.html' %}`, not `{% extends 'theme_name/templates/index.html' %}`.

## Installing a theme

The easiest way to install a theme is to clone its repository in the `themes`
directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone <theme repository URL>
```

Cloning the repository using Git or another VCS will allow you to easily
update. Alternatively, you can download the files manually and place
them in a folder.

You can find a list of themes [here](@/themes/_index.md).

## Using a theme

Now that you have the theme in your `themes` directory, you need to tell
Zola to use it by setting the `theme` variable in the
[configuration file](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md). The theme
name has to be the name of the directory you cloned the theme in.
For example, if you cloned a theme in `themes/simple-blog`, the theme name to use
in the configuration file is `simple-blog`. Also make sure to place the variable in the top level of the 
`.toml` hierarchy and not after a dict like [extra] or [markdown].
Some themes require additional configuration before they can work properly. Be sure to follow the instructions found on your chosen theme's documentation to properly configure the theme. 

## Customizing a theme

Any file from the theme can be overridden by creating a file with the same path and name in your `templates` or `static`
directory. Here are a few examples of that, assuming that the theme name is `simple-blog`:

```
templates/pages/post.html -> replace themes/simple-blog/templates/pages/post.html
templates/macros.html -> replace themes/simple-blog/templates/macros.html
static/js/site.js -> replace themes/simple-blog/static/js/site.js
```

You can also choose to only override parts of a page if a theme defines some blocks by extending it. If we wanted
to only change a single block from the `post.html` page in the example above, we could do the following:

```
{% extends "simple-blog/templates/pages/post.html" %}

{% block some_block %}
Some custom data
{% endblock %}
```

Most themes will also provide some variables that are meant to be overridden. This happens in the `extra` section
of the [configuration file](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md).
Let's say a theme uses a `show_twitter` variable and sets it to `false` by default. If you want to set it to `true`,
you can update your `config.toml` like so:

```toml
[extra]
show_twitter = true

You can modify files directly in the `themes` directory but this will make updating the theme harder and live reload

Themes are collections of layouts and styles used to facilitate the creation and management of Zola projects. As such, themes are Zola projects which provide their own templates, content and even static assets. 

Zola has built-in support for themes which makes it easy to customise and update them. 

All themes can use the full power of Zola, from shortcodes to Sass compilation.

A list of themes is available [here](@/themes/_index.md).

**[Complete Documentation is available here](https://abridge.pages.dev/overview-abridge/)**

## Quick Start

This theme requires version 0.19.1 or later of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git
cd abridge
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

## Installation

The Quick Start shows how to run the theme directly. Next we will use abridge as a theme to a NEW site.

### 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
yes "" | zola init mysite
cd mysite
```

### 2: Install Abridge

Add the theme as a git submodule:

```bash
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git themes/abridge
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Or clone the theme into your themes directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git themes/abridge
```

### 3: Configuration

Copy some files from the theme directory to your project's root directory:

```bash
rsync themes/abridge/.gitignore .gitignore
rsync themes/abridge/config.toml config.toml
rsync themes/abridge/content/_index.md content/
rsync -r themes/abridge/COPY-TO-ROOT-SASS/* sass/
rsync themes/abridge/netlify.toml netlify.toml
rsync themes/abridge/package_abridge.js package_abridge.js
rsync themes/abridge/package.json package.json
```

- `config.toml` base configuration with all config values.
- `content/_index.md` required to set pagination.
- `COPY-TO-ROOT-SASS/abridge.scss` overrides to customize Abridge variables.
- `netlify.toml` settings to deploy your repo with netlfiy.
- `package_abridge.js` node script to: update cache files list in PWA, minify js, bundle js
- `package.json` to facilitate use of package_abridge.js

Uncomment the theme line in your project's root config.toml:

```bash
sed -i 's/^#theme = "abridge"/theme = "abridge"/' config.toml
```

### 4: Add new content

Copy the content from the theme directory to your project or make a new post:

```bash
rsync -r themes/abridge/content .
```

### 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

Zola will start the dev web server, accessible by default at `http://127.0.0.1:1111`.

Saved changes will live reload in the browser. (press `ctrl+f5`, or while developing set `pwa=false` in `config.toml`)

## Customization

For further customization be sure to [check the docs](https://abridge.pages.dev/overview-abridge/).

## Sponsor

Do you love this theme? Was it useful to you? Please leave a github star, and if you feel inclined to donate you can make a donation to me through [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Jieiku/).

## Contributing and Philosophy

We'd love your help! Especially with fixes to issues, or improvements to existing features.

The goal is for Abridge to be lightweight, fast, and to work properly even if javascript is disabled or blocked.

The only feature that may be considered a necessity that relies on javascript is the Search.

# Academic Paper: a Zola theme

[Academic Paper](https://aterenin.github.io/academic-paper) is a Zola theme designed for hosting a website for scientific communication of an academic paper in the style of a blog post. 
A demo website built with Academic Paper can be found at [aterenin.github.io/academic-paper](https://aterenin.github.io/academic-paper), and an example repository using this theme can be found at [github.com/aterenin/papers.avt.im](https://github.com/aterenin/papers.avt.im), with links to the pages in this repository found at [avt.im/archive?papers](https://avt.im/archive?papers).

# Features

[Academic Paper](https://github.com/aterenin/academic-paper) is designed to be reasonably feature-complete. Its features include:

* An automatic header which lists the title, author, venue, year, and along with customizable buttons.
* Syntax highlighting and math rendering via KaTeX which can be done both client-side and server-side with appropriate configuration.
* Figures via a Zola shortcode `figure(alt=['Image alt text'],src=['path/to/image.png'])`, which supports captions, subfigures, subcaptions, and is rendered using responsive flexbox.
* Markdown footnotes via Zola's footnote support.
* Metadata including Twitter Summary Card, OpenGraph, and JSON-LD, implemented similar to [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag): these ensure pages are search-engine-fiendly and provide social media websites with links which are displayed when links are shared,

# Design and maintainability

[Academic Paper](https://github.com/aterenin/academic-paper) is [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/).
This means it follows a set of best practices which try to ensure websites correctly built with it will work correctly in the indefinite future with minimal maintenance, even as the internet changes and links break over time.
As consequence, the theme has no JavaScript or CSS dependencies if KaTeX is used server-side.

# Documentation

The examples below document the theme's options which are available in the TOML files, which are listed as comments within each file.

## Config.toml 

```toml
base_url = "https://example.com"
compile_sass = true # should be set to true
build_search_index = false # not used by the theme
generate_feed = false # not used by the theme
minify_html = true # to ensure correct rendering due to minification of whitespace, should be set to true, unless there is a reason to override it

[markdown]
highlight_code = true # should be set to true unless the page has no code to highlight
highlight_theme = "css" # this theme includes its own CSS-based styling of highlighting, so this should be set to CSS
# other Markdown options - as described in the Zola documentation - go here, and set according to user preference

[extra]
footer_text = "This website is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and the [Academic Paper](http://github.com/aterenin/academic-paper/) theme, which is [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)." # by default this page adds a small and non-intrusive footer with some text linking to this repository - you can set this to false to remove the footer if you prefer
server_side_katex = false # set to true to enable server-side KaTeX rendering via scripts/katex.js, this will also include KaTeX CSS and fonts in the build
```

## Page and section configuration

    {name = "Author 2", url = "https://example.com/", star = true}, # url is optional
    {name = "Author 3"},

star = 'Equal contribution' # adds the text 'Equal contribution' with a star superscript to the title
venue = {name = "Example Conference", date = 2023-12-10, url = "https://example.org/"} # date of publication should be listed here, to distinguish it from the date the website itself was written and updated, which can be added via Zola's built-in support
buttons = [ # this theme supports any set of buttons, but and will by default include an SVG icon for the examples listed below

button_shortcuts = [{variable = "video", name = "Video"}] # this configuration makes it possible to add a button to a page or section in a less-verbose way, for example by writing video = "/url/to/video" instead of buttons = [{name = "Video", url = "/url/to/video"}]
```

## Page configuration 

If using this theme for a list of seminars, each seminar should be added as a page within a suitable section. An example configuration is given here. 

```toml
+++
title = "Seminar Title"
[extra]
author = "Example Author" # name of the author goes here
institution = "Example Institution" # name of the institution goes here
author_url = "https://example.com" # the author's webpage, which the theme will create links to
time = "16:00 UTC" # the time of the seminar
buttons = [{name = "Example", url = "https://example.com/"}] # a list of buttons displayed on the page and in lists, shown in order
highlight = true # whether or not the seminar gets displayed on a page using the highlight shortcode, which is designed to display a short list of upcoming seminars on the theme's front page - defaults to false
image = "placeholder.svg" # optional: allows ont to override the default image URL

# Zola Theme AdiDoks

AdiDoks is a modern documentation theme, which is a port of the Hugo
theme [Doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) for Zola.

## Demo

[Live Preview](https://adidoks.netlify.app/).

## Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ 0.15.0.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git
cd adidoks
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

Read more from [the document of the AdiDoks](https://adidoks.org/docs/getting-started/introduction/).

## Installation

Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to
install the theme in an existing site step by step.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install AdiDoks

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd mysite
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git themes/adidoks
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Enable the theme in your `config.toml` in the site directory:

```toml
theme = "adidoks"
```

Or copy the `config.toml.example` from the theme directory to your project's
root directory:

```bash
cp themes/adidoks/config.toml.example config.toml
```

### Step 4: Add new content

You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```bash
cp -r themes/adidoks/content .
```

You can modify or add new posts in the `content/blog`, `content/docs` or other
content directories as needed.

### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

AdiDoks will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## Customisation

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `theme.toml`, `content` files and templates files in this
repo for an idea.

### Global Configuration

There are some configuration options that you can customize in `config.toml`.

#### Configuration options before `extra` options

Set the authors's taxonomies for the site.

```toml
taxonomies = [
  {name = "authors"},
]
```

Use search function for the content.

```toml
build_search_index = true
```

#### Configuration options under the `extra`

The following options should be under the `[extra]` in `config.toml`

- `language_code` - set HTML file language (default to `en-US`)
- `theme_color` - your site's HTML color (default to `#fff`)
- `title_separator` - the separator to your site title, like `|` and `-` (defaults to `|`)
- `title_addition` - the additon content for the title of the homepage
- `timeformat` - the timeformat for the blog article published date
- `timezone` - the timezone for the blog article published date
- `edit_page` (and `docs_repo`, `repo_branch`) - whether to show the edit page in the github repo for your docs
- `math` (and `library`) - set KaTeX or MathJax library
- `[extra.open]` - Open Graph + Twitter Cards for the site
- `[extra.schema]` - set JSON-LD for the site
- `[[extra.menu.main]]` - the header navigations for the site
- `[[extra.menu.social]]` - the social links on the header of the page
- `[extra.footer]` - the footer content on the left
- `[[extra.footer.nav]]` - the footer navigations on the right

### Templates

All pages are extend to the `base.html`, and you can customize them as need.

### Content

#### Homepage

Go to the *content/_index.md* file to add your own homepage content.

- `[extra]` - the main content of the homepage
- `[[extra.ist]]` - the lists' content of the homepage

#### Sections

Each section includes a `_index.md`, and you can customize it or add your new
section under the `content` folder.

#### Pages

There are mainly three types of pages in the site.

- `blog` - blog article
- `docs` - documentation article
- `authors` - authors page if you need to add some information for a new author

# after-dark

![after-dark screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Features

- [x] Code Snippet Clipboards
- [x] Latex Support
- [ ] Light/Dark mode support
- [x] Search functionality

## Contents

- Installation
- Options
  - Top menu
  - Title
  - Author
  - Code Snippets
  - LaTex Support
  - Searchbar

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/getzola/after-dark.git
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "after-dark"
```

This theme requires your index section (`content/_index.md`) to be paginated to work:

```toml
paginate_by = 5
```

The posts should therefore be in directly under the `content` folder.

The theme requires tags and categories taxonomies to be enabled in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    # You can enable/disable RSS
    {name = "categories", feed = true},
    {name = "tags", feed = true},
]
```

If you want to paginate taxonomies pages, you will need to overwrite the templates
as it only works for non-paginated taxonomies by default.

## Options

### Top-menu

Set a field in `extra` with a key of `after_dark_menu`:

```toml
after_dark_menu = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL", name = "Home"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags"},
    {url = "https://google.com", name = "Google"},
]
```

If you put `$BASE_URL` in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual
site URL.

### Title

The site title is shown on the homepage. As it might be different from the `<title>`
element that the `title` field in the config represents, you can set the `after_dark_title`
instead.

### Author

You can set this on a per page basis or in the config file.

`config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
author = "John Smith"
```

In a page (wrap this in +++):

```toml
title = "..."
date = 1970-01-01

[extra]
author = "John Smith"
```

### Code Snippets

Syntax Highlighting:

```toml
[markdown]
# Whether to do syntax highlighting
# Theme can be customized by setting the `highlight_theme` variable to a theme supported by Zola
highlight_code = true

highlight_theme = "one-dark"
```

Enhanced Codeblocks (Clipboard Support and Language Tags)

To enable enhanced codeblocks, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
codeblock = true
```

### LaTex Support

To enable LaTeX support with MathJax, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
latex = true
```

### Searchbar

To enable a searchbar at the top of the page navigation, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
build_search_index = true

[search]
index_format = "elasticlunr_json"

[extra]
enable_search = true
```

# Albatros theme for Zola

This theme was made for [Duniter](https://duniter.fr/) website. It was then abstracted and turned into **Albatros**.

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Installation

Add the theme as a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add --name albatros https://git.42l.fr/HugoTrentesaux/albatros.git themes/albatros
```

and enable the theme in your `config.toml`

theme = "albatros"

## Features

It has a lot of feature that I could not find time to document yet. Most of the available customization is in `theme.toml`/`extra` section and `sass/_albatros.sass` file (e.g. for colors).

See:

- https://duniter.fr/
- https://duniter.org/

for reference.

### Landing pages

You are encouraged to provide custom landing pages that you can write in `template/custom`.
The theme will take care of the rest (pages organised as wiki with breadcrumb).

### Authors

Each author must have a card in `content/team` folder.

## Support

I'll provide support on demand on [Zola forum](https://zola.discourse.group/) by documenting the theme step by step.

# Anatole Theme for Zola

*[Anatole theme for Farbox](https://github.com/hi-caicai/farbox-theme-Anatole) ported to Zola*

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

![screenshot-mobile](./screenshot-mobile.png)

![screenshot-dark](./screenshot-dark.png)

![screenshot-mobile-dark](./screenshot-mobile-dark.png)

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/longfangsong/anatole-zola.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "anatole-zola"
```

And copy the `content/about`, `content/archive`, `content/_index.md` in the theme folder to your own content folder. And edit the `_index.md` in `about` folder to edit the content of your `about` page.

## Options

### Basic

Add `title`, `description` and `base_url`:

```toml
title = "Anatole"
description = "A other zola theme"
base_url = "https://example.com"
```

### Mode

Though the origin theme only support light mode, we added a dark mode option here.

You can either
- set the `extra.mode` field in `config.toml` to use the dark/light mode
- or set the `extra.default_mode` field in `config.toml` to read the dark/light mode from `localStorage` (the key is `'mode'`), and use some Javascript to control the theme each reader is using
- or do nothing, we'll use light mode by default

### Language

Currently, we have English, Chinese, German and Swedish translations, set the `default_language` if necessary:

```toml
# 如果你想要中文
default_language = "zh"
```

If there are complications, you can copy this snippet to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[languages.en.translations]
language_name = "English"
about = "About"
home = "Home"
tags = "Tags"
archive = "Archive"
links = "Links"
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"
next_page = "Next Page"
last_page = "Last Page"

[languages.zh.translations]
language_name = "中文"
home = "首页"
about = "关于"
tags = "标签"
archive = "归档"
links = "友链"
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"
next_page = "下一页"
last_page = "上一页"

[languages.de.translations]
language_name = "Deutsch"
about = "Info"
home = "Home"
tags = "Kategorien"
archive = "Archiv"
links = "Links"
date_format = "%d-%m-%Y"
next_page = "Nächste Seite"
last_page = "Vorherige Seite"

[languages.sv.translations]
language_name = "Svenska"
about = "Info"
home = "Hem"
tags = "Etiketter"
archive = "Arkiv"
links = "Länkar"
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"
next_page = "Nästa Sidan"
last_page = "Sista Sidan"
```

Feel free to create a pull request if you want to translate the theme into other languages!
#### Multilingual

The theme will become multilingual automatically if you specify another language except `default_language`.

You'll see a language-switching button on top right.


### Sections

Tags and links sections are optional.

- If you want to enable the tags page, add
  ```toml
  taxonomies = [
    {name = "tags"},
  ]

  [extra.show]
  tags = true
  ```
  To your `config.toml`

- If you want to enable the links page, add

  ```toml
  [extra.show]
  links = true
  ```

  and copy `content/links` to your own `content` library. And edit the `_index.md` in it to modify its content.

- If you want to add the author's name on each page, add:

  ```toml
  [extra]
  author = "John Doe"
  ```

### Sidebar menu

We support a bunch of social links:

```toml
[extra.social]
github = ""
gitlab = ""
stackoverflow = "" # use user_id
twitter = ""
mastodon = "" # use hostname/@username
facebook = ""
instagram = ""
dribbble = ""
weibo = ""
linkedin = ""
flickr = ""
```

Fill in your username if you want! And the logo won't appear if you leave it empty.



### Comment system

We currently support...

- [Valine](https://valine.js.org/quickstart.html):

```toml
[extra.comment.valine]
appid = "Your appid goes here"
appkey = "Your appkey goes here"
notify = false # true/false: mail notify https://github.com/xCss/Valine/wiki/Valine-%E8%AF%84%E8%AE%BA%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E9%82%AE%E4%BB%B6%E6%8F%90%E9%86%92%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE
verify = false # true/false: verify code
avatar = "mm" # avatar style https://github.com/xCss/Valine/wiki/avatar-setting-for-valine
placeholder = "Say something here"
```

- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/admin/create/), note that Disqus does not work in Mainland China:

```toml
[extra.comment.disqus]
name = "longfangsong"
```

- [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/):

```toml
[extra.comment.utterances]
repo = "Your repo for comments"
issue_term = "pathname"
theme = "github-light"
```


## Customize

There are several options I left in the origin templates for you to customize your site.

### More style

You can create a `blog.scss` or something similiar in the your `sass` folder, add a `templates.html` with following content:

```html
{%/* extends "anatole-zola/templates/basic.html" */%}
{%/* block extra_head */%}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{/* get_url(path="blog.css") */}}">
{%/* endblock */%}
```

### More social links

You can add more social links by adding a `templates.html` with some content added to `more_social_link` block:

```html
{%/* extends "anatole-zola/templates/basic.html" */%}
{%/* block more_social_link */%}
<div id="pirate" data-wordart-src="//cdn.wordart.com/json/685czi4rqil5" style="width: 100%;" data-wordart-show-attribution></div>
{%/* endblock */%}
```

If you want to use some awesome logos, [FontAwesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) are already available.

# Andromeda Theme for Zola

> Andromeda is a lightweight **photojournal & blog** theme designed for Zola.

With built-in support for galleries and some options for customization, Andromeda is designed for photojournalism without complications. 

Index demo:
![Index demo graphic](index_demo.jpg)

Post demo:

---

## Installation

Assuming you already have a site set up (see the [Zola guide for setting up a site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/)), 

1. Create a `themes` directory in the root of your site if it does not already exist. 
2. Clone the theme into your themes directory: 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Pixadus/andromeda-theme themes/andromeda
    ```
3. Duplicate the structure of the the `config.toml` file found in `themes/andromeda/config.toml` or [this repository](https://github.com/Pixadus/andromeda-theme/blob/main/config.toml) within your own `config.toml`.
4. Set the theme to Andromeda, by including `theme = andromeda` in your `config.toml` file.

## Creating pages

To create a new post, create a `.md` file within `/content`, with the header format:

```markdown 
+++
title = "Post title"
date = 2023-04-25
description = "Post description"
extra = {header_img = "image-url"}
+++
```
**Note**: The +++ are necessary.

The `header_img` field is the image shown on the homepage of the blog and in the heading of each page. It can be a remote URL or local - if local, by default this will be files stored in the `static` folder, or `/images` in the URL. 

### Galleries

Galleries can be set up by using the following template in your Markdown file:

```html
<div class="gallery">
    <a href="original_photo1.jpg" data-ngthumb="thumbnail_photo1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="original_photo2.jpg" data-ngthumb="thumbnail_photo2.jpg"></a>
</div>
```

For more or less photos, use `<a href>` tags. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) provides a good hosting option as it automatically generates thumbnails for you. 

## Configuration

Andromeda supports custom navbar links - see [config.toml](https://github.com/Pixadus/andromeda-theme/blob/main/config.toml) for an example. You may also set a custom `favicon.ico` though `config.toml`. 

If you wish to customize the design of the gallery, basic Javascript knowledge will be necessary. Andromeda uses `nanogallery2` by default - the [documentation can be found here](https://nanogallery2.nanostudio.org/documentation.html). Customizations to the gallery design are done within the `{%/* macro pagefooter() */%}` block within `/templates/macros.html`. 

By default, this script is divided into three sections (indicated by `item==`): single-image, two-image and three+ image gallery setups.

# anemone

Introducing "anemone," a minimalist [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme that prioritizes clean CSS and avoids heavy JavaScript. Enjoy a seamless user experience with lightning-fast load times. Let your content take center stage in a clutter-free, elegant design that enhances readability. Responsive and efficient, anemone brings focus to your ideas.

You can browse the demo website [here](https://anemone.pages.dev/)
I also use it on my own [website.](https://speyllsite.pages.dev/)

Anemone is a versatile Zola theme that comes with both light and dark variants. You can easily switch between the light and dark themes to suit your preferences.

![Anemone Light and Dark Theme](screenshot.png)

## Installation

To get started with Anemone, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/Speyll/anemone
```

2. Enable Anemone in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "anemone"
```

## Release Notes

#### 2025-04-09

This release introduces a **complete rewrite** of the project: simplified, improved, and optimized across the board.

**If you are updating from an older release:**
1. Open your `config.toml` file and update it as needed (compare with the latest release for reference).
2. Remove the following line from `content/blog/_index.md`:
   ```toml
   page_template = "blog-page.html"
   ```

#### 2024-03-02
This release brings several improvements and enhancements, focusing mainly on optimizing performance and user experience. Here's a summary of the key changes:

- **suCSS Integration:** The core CSS now leverages the lightweight [suCSS framework](https://speyll.github.io/suCSS/) made by yours truly, providing better maintainability, robustness, and scalability. With suCSS, the theme should maintain consistent appearance across different browsers.

- **Enhanced Theme Toggle:** The dark and light theme toggle has been revamped for more consistency. Now, the website respects the user's system-wide theme settings, ensuring a seamless experience. Additionally, the toggle retains the selected theme for future visits, offering improved usability.

- **Smooth Transition and Sound Effect:** Enjoy a smoother transition between the dark and light mode accompanied by a subtle sound effect. Rest assured, the added sound effect incurs minimal performance overhead, with the file size being just 1kb.

- **Class Names and Shortcodes Update:** Some class names and shortcodes have been modified for better organization and clarity. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

- **Slight change in Color Choice:** Some dark mode colors have been changed for the sake of readability, still using [veqev](https://github.com/Speyll/veqev).


## Options

Anemone provides various options to customize your website:

#### Default Taxonomies

To use tags, add the following code to a page's metadata:

```toml
[taxonomies]
tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]
```

#### Pages List in Homepage

Enable listing of pages in the homepage by adding the following code to `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
list_pages = true
```

#### Multilanguage

The theme has a built-in feature that allows you to use multiple languages. For detailed instructions on how to use this feature, you can refer to the [Zola Multilingual documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/). This documentation provides additional information on how to make the most out of this multilingual capability.

```toml
[languages.fr]
weight = 2
title = "anemone"
languageName = "Français"
languageCode = "fr"
```
#### Multilanguage-Ready Navigation Bar

Customize the header navigation links with the following code in the `extra` section of `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

header_nav = [
  { url = "/", name_en = "/home/", name_fr = "/accueil/" },
  { url = "/about", name_en = "/about/", name_fr = "/concernant/" },
  { url = "/journal", name_en = "/journal/", name_fr = "/journal/" },
  { url = "/blog", name_en = "/blog/", name_fr = "/blog/" }
]
```

#### Add Table of Contents (TOC) to Pages

In a page's frontmatter, set `extra.toc` to `true`:

```toml
[extra]
toc = true
```

#### Display Author Name in Blog Posts

Customize the display of the author's name in your blog posts by toggling the `display_author` variable to either `true` or `false`:

```toml
[extra]
display_author = true
```

### Webrings

Add a webring with a shortcode:

```html
{{/* webring(prev="#", webring="#", webringName="Random Webring", next="#") */}}
```

### Extra Data

- Set the `author` in both the main config and in pages metadata.
- Similarly, set `favicon` in the main config, and it will be used as the site icon.
- Set `footer_content_license` and `footer_content_license_link` if you wish to display content license information in the footer.


### License

The Anemone theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

# Anpu theme for Zola

This is a port of the Hugo theme [Anubis](https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis/tree/master/layouts) for [Zola](https://getzola.org).

## Screenshots

| Light mode | Dark mode |
| :------: | :-----------: |
| ![light mode website screenshot](screenshot-light.png) | ![dark mode website screenshot](screenshot-dark.png) |

## Usage

In order to use the theme you need to clone this repository in your `themes` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zbrox/anpu-zola-theme.git themes/anpu
```

Then set your theme setting in `config.toml` to `anpu`:

```toml
theme = "anpu"
```

This theme requires both the `tags` and `categories` taxonomies.

```toml
taxonomies = [
    { name = "categories" },
    { name = "tags" },
]
```

## How To Customize

There are two things you can customize:

- The links to be included in the menu
- The date format of the posts

### Menu links

In your `config.toml` under the `[extra]` section you need to set the `anpu_menu_links` list.

Example:

```toml
[extra]
anpu_menu_links = [
    { url = "$BASE_URL/about/", name = "About" },
]
```

If you include `$BASE_URL` in the url of a link it will be replaced to the base url of your site.

### Date format

In your `config.toml` under the `[extra]` section you need to set the `anpu_date_format` value.

Example:

```toml
[extra]
anpu_date_format = "%e %B %Y"
```

The formatting uses the standart `date` filter in Tera. The date format options you can use are listed in the [chrono crate documentation](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#date).

## Config

### Customize `<meta/>` tags

The following TOML and YAML code will yiled two `<meta/>` tags, `<meta property="og:title" content="the og title"/>`, `<meta property="og:description" content="the og description"/>`.

TOML:

```toml
title = "post title"
description = "post desc"
date = "2023-01-01"

[extra]
meta = [
    {property = "og:title", content = "the og title"},
    {property = "og:description", content = "the og description"},
]
```

YAML:

```yaml
title: "post title"
description: "post desc"
date: "2023-01-01"
extra:
  meta:
    - property: "og:title"
      content: "the og title"
    - property: "og:description"
      content: "the og description"
```

If the `og:title`, the `og:description`, or the "description" are not set, the page's title and description will be used. That is, the following TOML code generates `<meta property="og:title" content="post title"/>`, `<meta property="og:description" content="post desc"/>`, and `<meta property="og:description" content="post desc"/>` as default values.

```toml
title = "post title"
description = "post desc"
date = "2023-01-01"
```

### Theme config

Cause Zola limited custom config must under the `extra` field, so there are some different with the origin theme:

Demo website config.toml:

```toml
# control dark mode: auto | dark | toggle
mode = "toggle"

# subtitle will show under the title in index page
subtitle = "A zola theme forked from [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie)"

# if set true, will use external CDN resource to load font and js file
useCDN = false

favicon = "/icon/favicon.png"

# show in the footer
copyright = "keith"

# config your Google Analysis ID
ga = "XXXX-XXXXX"

# optional: config your i18n entry
[extra.translations]
languages = [{name = "en", url = "/"}]

# config multi-language menu and other text
[[extra.translations.en]]
show_more = "Read more ⟶"
previous_page = "← Previous"
next_page = "Next →"
posted_on = "on "
posted_by = "Published by"
read_time = "minute read"
all_tags = "All tags"
menus = [
    { name = "Home", url = "/", weight = 2 },
    { name = "All posts", url = "/posts", weight = 2 },
    { name = "About", url = "/about", weight = 3 },
    { name = "Tags", url = "/tags", weight = 4 },
]

# config social icon info in the footer
[[extra.social]]
icon = "github"
name = "GitHub"
url = "https://github.com/XXXMrG/archie-zola"

[[extra.social]]
icon = "twitter"
name = "Twitter"
url = "https://github.com/your-name/"

[[extra.social]]
icon = "gitlab"
name = "GitLab"
url = "https://gitlab.com/your-name/"

```

### Latex math formula support

This theme support latex math formula, by using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

You can enable it by add `katex_enable = true` in the `extra` section of config.toml:

```toml
[extra]
katex_enable = true
```

After that, you can use latex math formula in your markdown file:

```
$$
{x: \mathbf{Num},\ y: \mathbf{Num} \over x + y : \mathbf{Num} }\ (\text{N-Add})
$$
```

You can also use inline and block-style:

```
1. \\( \KaTeX \\) inline
2. \\[ \KaTeX \\]
3. $$ \KaTeX $$
```

### Content config

**In content/posts/\_index.md. I use Zola config: transparent = true to implement the pagination**

In Zola, you can use config in the \_index.md to control pagination and sort post list:

```toml
paginate_by = 3
sort_by = "date"

[taxonomies]
tags = ["FE", "Rust"]

[extra]
author = { name = "XXXMRG", social= "https://github.com/XXXMrG" }
```

# Ataraxia

[![Ataraxia preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gersonbenavides/ataraxia-zola/main/mockup.png "Ataraxia mockup")](https://gersonbenavides.github.io/)

A personal theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) focused on readability that aims to be simple, beautiful, and modern. It is designed to support multiple languages and be highly customizable.

The theme takes visual inspiration from the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and [Neumorphism](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism) themes.

## Installation

Open a command terminal at your site path and run:

```bash
cd themes
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gersonbenavides/ataraxia-zola.git ataraxia
```

## Configuration

Copy the `config_sample.toml` file to your site's main path, then rename it to `config.toml` and edit it with your site data.

> You can see the [Gerson's website](https://github.com/gersonbenavides/gersonbenavides.github.io) repository for theme setup guide.

For the site to work properly you need to create a `_index.md` file within the `content` path with the following structure:

```toml
+++
title = "Home"
description = "Home site description."
sort_by = "date"
template = "index.html"
page_template = "page.html"
+++
```

You can add more markdown content inside this file if you need to.

If you want to enable the site's blog, create a _index.md file inside the `content/blog` path then copy the following structure inside the file:

```toml
+++
title = "Blog"
description = "Blog site description."
sort_by = "date"
paginate_by = 5
template = "blog.html"
page_template = "blog_page.html"
+++
```

You can display the result of your website by running:

```bash
zola serve
```


## Hacking

By default, the theme comes with all the scss styles already compiled, in such a way that the installation of Bootstrap is not necessary, in order to avoid dependencies such as Node.js in the production file.

If you want to edit the theme's styles, you'll need to have a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) interpreter and a [Sass compiler](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed. After that, go to the main path of the theme and execute:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
sass --watch scss/custom.scss:static/assets/css/custom.css
```

> Keep in mind that the main branch of this repository only has the stable versions of the theme, if you want to see the development status and the unstable versions, change to the corresponding branch.

## Credits

This theme is mainly built on [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), plus it makes use of [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

# Zola ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/121b53ce-c913-4604-9179-eb3cca31cd2c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zola-bearblog/deploys)

🧸 A [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)-theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.

## Demo

This theme has multiple demo sites, to provide examples of how to set up deployment
- [Vercel](https://zola-bearblog.vercel.app/)
- [Netlify](https://zola-bearblog.netlify.app/)
- [Gitlab Pages](https://alanpearce.gitlab.io/zola-bearblog)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://zola-bearblog.pages.dev/)

## Screenshot

![Screenshot][screenshot]

When the user's browser is running »dark mode«, the dark color scheme will be used automatically. The default is the light/white color scheme. Check out the [`style.html`](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog/src/branch/main/templates/style.html)-file for the implementation.

## Installation

If you already have a Zola site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```
git submodule add https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog themes/zola-bearblog
```

Then, adjust the `config.toml` as detailed below.

For more information, read the official [setup guide][zola-setup-guide] of Zola.

Alternatively, you can quickly deploy a copy of the theme site to Netlify using this button:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://gitlab.com/alanpearce/zola-bearblog)

(Note that this method makes it harder to keep up-to-date with theme updates, which might be necessary for newer versions of Zola.)

## Adjust configuration / config.toml

Please check out the included [config.toml](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog/src/branch/main/config.toml)

## Content & structure

### Menu

Create an array in `extra` with a key of `main_menu`. `url` is passed to [`get_url`](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/#get-url)

```toml
[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Home"
url = "@/_index.md"

[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Bear"
url = "@/bear.md"

[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Zola"
url = "@/zola.md"

[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Blog"
url = "@/blog/_index.md"
```

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.


### Adding your branding / colors / css

Add a `custom_head.html`-file to your `templates/`-directory. In there you may add a `<style>`-tag, *or* you may add a `<link>`-tag referencing your own `custom.css` (in case you prefer to have a separate `.css`-file). Check out the [`style.html`](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog/src/branch/main/templates/style.html)-file to find out which CSS-styles are applied by default.

### Table of contents

Table of contents are not rendered by default. To render them, set `extra.table_of_contents.show = true` in `config.toml`.

The table of contents is rendered inside a `details` element.
If you want the section to be collapsed on page load, set `extra.table_of_contents.visible_on_load = false`.
This defaults to `true`.

In addition, `extra.table_of_contents.max_level` can limit the maximum level of headers to show.
To show only `h1`s, set `max_level = 1`, to show `h1`s and `h2`s, set `max_level = 2`, and so on.
By default, `max_level` is set to 6, so all headers on the page are shown.

Below is an example of how to configure the table of contents in `config.toml`.

```toml
[extra.table_of_contents]
show = true
max_level = 2
visible_on_load = false
```

It can also be toggled on page-by-page basis. Add `extra.hide_table_of_contents = true` to the page's frontmatter to hide the table of contents for that specific page.

# Blow
A [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) theme built with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)  

(WIP) Example : [Here](https://tchartron.com)  

## Preview
![preview](screenshot.png)

## Usage
You should follow the [official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) about installing a Zola theme.  

I recommend adding the theme as a git submodule :  
```bash
cd my-zola-website
git submodule add -b main git@github.com:tchartron/blow.git themes/blow
```

Edit the theme used in your `config.toml` file
```toml
# The site theme to use.
theme = "blow"
```

Then edit your `config.toml` file to override values from the theme :
```toml
[extra]
enable_search = true
enable_sidebar = true
enable_adsense = true
enable_multilingue = true
adsense_link = "https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=myclientid"

[extra.lang]
items = [
    { lang = "en", links = [
        { base_url = "/", name = "English" },
        { base_url = "/fr", name = "French" },
    ] },
    { lang = "fr", links = [

## Syntax Highlighting
Blow makes use of Zola code highlighting feature.  
It supports setting a different color scheme depending on the user selected theme (Dark / Light)  
In order to use it you should select the color scheme you want to use for light and dark themes in the list provided [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/#syntax-highlighting) and edit your `config.toml` file like this example :  
```toml
highlight_theme = "css"

highlight_themes_css = [
  { theme = "ayu-dark", filename = "syntax-dark.css" },
  { theme = "ayu-light", filename = "syntax-light.css" },
]
```

## Custom Footer Content
To overwrite the default footer (copyright notice), extend the `layout.html` template of the theme as described in the [Zola documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/extending-a-theme/#overriding-a-block) by creating a `layout.html` with the following content in your `templates` directory:

```jinja
{%/* extends "blow/templates/layout.html" */%}

{%/* block content_footer */%}
Here is my own footer with a <a href="http://example.com">link</a>.
{%/* endblock */%}
```

# book

A theme based on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com), to write documentation
or books.

![book screenshot](https://github.com/Keats/book/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)


## Contents

- Installation
- Options
  - Numbered chapters

## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/getzola/book.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "book"
# Optional, if you want search
build_search_index = true
```

## Usage
Book will generate a book from the files you place in the `content` directory.  Your book
can have two levels of hierarchy: chapters and subchapters.

Each chapter should be a `section` within the Gutenberg site and should have an `_index.md`
file that sets its `weight` front-matter variable to its chapter number.  For example,
chapter 2 should have `weight = 2`.  Additionally, each chapter should also set the
`sort_by = "weight"` in its front matter.

Each subchapter should be a `page` and should have its `weight` variable set to the subchapter
number.  For example, subchapter 3.4 should have `weight = 4`.

Finally, you should create an `_index.md` file and set the `redirect_to` front-matter variable
to redirect to the first section of your content.  For example, if your first section has the
slug `introduction`, then you would set `redirect_to = "introduction"`.

## Options

### Numbered chapters
By default, the `book` theme will number the chapters and pages in the left menu.
You can disable that by setting the `book_number_chapters` in `extra`:

```toml
book_number_chapters = false
```

### Current section pages only
By default, the `book` theme will list all the pages in the current section.
You can disable that by setting the `book_only_current_section_pages` in `extra`:

```toml
book_only_current_section_pages = false
```

A port of the StartBootstrap Clean Blog theme, for Zola.

## Demo

[Live Demo](https://zola-clean-blog.netlify.com)

## Usage

To use the theme, clone this repository to your `themes` directory.
It requires that you use the categories and tags taxonomies.
This can be done with the following additions to `config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "zola-clean-blog"

taxonomies = [
    {name = "categories", rss = true, paginate_by=5},
    {name = "tags", rss = true, paginate_by=5},
]
```

## Features

- Paginated Home/Categories/Tag Pages
- Customizable Menu
- Customizable Social Links

## How To Customize

- To replace header images, add a new image to `static/img/$page-bg.jpg` where `$page` is one of `about`, `home`, `post` or `contact`.

- To replace the copyright field, create your own `templates/index.html` to extend the template and add a `copyright` block:
```
{%/* extends "zola-clean-blog/templates/index.html" */%}
{%/* block copyright */%}
Copyright %copy; Example, Inc. 2016-2019
{%/* endblock copyright */%}
```

- To add a new menu item, override `clean_blog_menu` in your `config.toml`. You can use `$BASE_URL` to reference your own site.

- To add a new social link, override `clean_blog_social` in your `config.toml`. You can use `$BASE_URL` to reference your own site.

- To add Google Analytics, you may add your script to the `extrascripts` block using your own `index.html`
```
{%/* extends "zola-clean-blog/templates/index.html" */%}
{%/* block analytics */%}
<script>
...
</script>
{%/* endblock analytics */%}

# Codinfox-Zola

![Zola Deploy to Github Pages on push](https://github.com/svavs/codinfox-zola/workflows/Zola%20Deploy%20to%20Pages%20on%20push/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.com) theme inspired to [Codinfox-Lanyon](https://codinfox.github.com/), a Lanyon based theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). See a live demo [here](https://codinfox-zola.vercel.app/).

This theme places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer.

* Built for [Zola](https://www.getzola.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* Coded with [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org)

This theme supports:

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color (changing in `_config.scss`)
2. Changable sidebar locations (reverse it by changing the boolean value in `_config.scss`)
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. Support for multilingual sites
5. Support for Gravatar
6. and numerous improvements over original Lanyon and Codinfox-Lanyon

All the configuration variables and their meaning are inside:

- `config.toml` (for the zola config variables and some extra variables required by this theme),
- `author.toml` (for the personal informations to be displayed about the author of the site),
- `nav.toml` (for the navigation menu structure available in the site's sidebar)
- `_config.scss` (for the definition of some css customizations)

The options are fairly straightforward and described in comments.

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/svavs/codinfox-zola).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/svavs/codinfox-zola/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/svavs).

### Before you start

[Get a gravatar account](https://gravatar.com) and set this up with a profile image.

#### Add gravatar profile image to codinfox-zola theme

1. login to gravatar.com
2. click My Profile
3. click **view profile** in RH sidebar beneath profile name
4. click JSON
5. copy the `hash` value on line 4
6. paste the `hash` value to `author.toml` line 10


### Install and use

To use this theme you can follow the instruction required by any Zola theme.

Simply clone this repository under the `themes` folder of your site's main folder.

Then, define the required extra variables in the config.toml (take it from the config.toml file of the theme), create and define the author.toml and nav.toml configuration files in the main folder of your site (the same level of the config.toml), and that's it!

To define your own home picture, put an image file in the `static/img/` folder and set the path in the config.extra.image variable.

Now is possible to create the content inside the `content` folder as usual for Zola sites.

If you want to have a Blog with this theme, then create a folder inside the `content` folder containing all the blog posts in Markdown format. Zola automatically generate a section that you can manage as a blog. See an example in the [live demo](https://codinfox-zola.vercel.app/blog/).

# d3c3nt

d3c3nt is a simple, clean, and flexible theme for personal sites, made
by [FIGBERT] for the [Zola static site engine][zola]. This theme is
developed mainly for use on my personal site, so new features and styles
will be added when I stumble onto the need to make them.

All in all, it's fairly... decent.

## installation

To use d3c3nt in your own site, you have to add it to your `themes`
directory. You can do this in a variety of ways, but I recommend adding
it as a git submodule:

```
$ cd themes/
$ git submodule add git://git.figbert.com/d3c3nt.git
```

After installing the theme, set the top-level `theme` variable to
`"d3c3nt"` in your `config.toml`.

For more information about Zola themes in general, check out Zola's
[official site][zola-docs]. To find out more about d3c3nt's features and
configuration, head over to the [project's docs][docs].

# Daisy Theme

> You can find this theme on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy) and [Github](https://github.com/awinterstein/zola-theme-daisy).

A beautiful and fast [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) theme build on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) with 37 different color schemes included. See an example of the *autumn* colors here:

![Screenshot](https://codeberg.org/awinterstein/zola-theme-daisy/raw/branch/main/screenshot.png)

The theme is responsive and works very well on mobile devices:

<img src="https://codeberg.org/awinterstein/zola-theme-daisy/raw/branch/main/screenshot-mobile.png" alt="Mobile Screenshot" width="200"/>

## Features

* Responsive design (looks good on desktop and mobile)
* Automatically selected dark / light modes
* 37 color schemes included
* Customizable navbar and footer (with social links)
* Can be used with any Zola taxonomies (e.g., tags, categories)
* Search functionality
* Multi-language support
* Pagination
* Customizable favicon
* Error 404 page

### Styling

The Daisy theme supports all [built-in color themes of DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/#enable-a-built-in-theme) plus a light and dark color scheme that I created for my own website. The color themes can optionally even be switched at runtime.

![DaisyUI Color Themes](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy/raw/branch/main/daisyui-themes.png)

## Quick Start

The installation of the theme works the same as for other Zola themes. As it is described in the [official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/). Hence, it fist needs to be added as a git submodule:

```bash
cd my-zola-website
git submodule add -b main \
    https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy.git \
    themes/daisy
```

Please make sure to add it at the path `themes/daisy` in your Zola directory. The translations and the icons won't work if added to a different directory.

As the second step, it can be enabled then in the `config.toml` file of your website:

```toml
theme = "daisy"
```

For starting to create a new Zola website using this theme, the you can also just checkout / fork the [example repository](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy-example) and adapt it to your needs. That repository already contains a structure and configuration for the Zola-based website.

## Configuration

See the following sections for information on the possible configurations for the theme in the your `config.toml` file.

### Color Schemes

Set a light and dark color scheme:

```toml
daisyui_theme_light = "light"
daisyui_theme_dark = "dark"
```

See the `themes` list in the [`theme.toml`](theme.toml) for all possible identifiers. You can also set only a light or a dark color scheme, if you do not want the automatic dark mode switching based on the browser settings of your visitors.

If you want to allow your visitors to change the used color scheme, just set the following variable in the `[extra]` section of your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
enable_theme_switching = true
```

There will be a dropdown in the navbar then, for the visitors to select form the color schemes.

### Languages

To enable support for multiple languages, simply set the default language and add language settings for all your additional languages:

```toml
default_language = "en"

[languages.de]
# title and description in the additional language
title = "Daisy Theme"
description = "Beispiel- und Demoseite des Daisy-Themas für Zola."

# don't forget to enable features like search or feed
# generation for the additional language as well
build_search_index = true
generate_feeds = true

# also any taxonomies of your default language need to
# be defined for the additional language as well
taxonomies = [
    { name = "tags", paginate_by = 2, feed = true },
    { name = "directors", paginate_by = 2, feed = true },
]
```

Taxonomies should have exactly the same (not translated) name in all languages, for the language switching to work best.

You need to create an i18n file containing the translations for all theme variables for all the languages of your website, if they are not included in the theme. Right now, [English](i18n/en.toml), [German](i18n/de.toml) and [Hungarian](i18n/hu.toml) are included. You can create a the directory `i18n` in your website root directory and the language files in there will be picked up by the theme. It would be great, however, if you create a [pull-request](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy/pulls) on the theme repository to add your translations to the theme.

### Search

Integrating a search into your website is as easy as adding the following to your configuration:

```toml
# enable it globally for the default language
build_search_index = true

[search]
# only this format is supported by the theme
index_format = "elasticlunr_json"

# you need to enable search at all your language sections as well
[languages.de]
build_search_index = true
```

As soon as `build_search_index` is enabled, the search indices are created for all languages that have this variable enabled in their section in the `config.toml` and the search bar is shown in the navbar of the website.

Just be aware, that you need to add an [Elasticlunr.js](http://elasticlunr.com/)-compatible [Lunr Languages](https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages) file to your `static` directory, if you are using other languages than English and German. See the corresponding repository for the [`min` files](https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages/tree/master/min). Feel free to add support for your languages to the theme as well, via a [pull-request](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy/pulls).

### Navbar

Arbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the `[extra.navbar]` section:

```toml
[extra.navbar]
links = [
    { url = "blog", i18n_key = "posts" },
    { url = "tags", i18n_key = "tags" },
    { url = "movies", i18n_key = "movies" },
]
```

The value of the `i18n_key` must be in the `i18n` files for your languages (see [en.toml](i18n/en.toml), for example).

### Footer

All three parts of the footer can be adapted: the links, the social icons, and the copyright notice.

#### Links

Arbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the `[extra.footer]` section:

```toml
[extra.footer]
links = [
    { url = "about", i18n_key = "about" },
    { url = "sitemap.xml", i18n_key = "sitemap", no_translation = true },
]
```

The value of the `i18n_key` must be in the `i18n` files for your languages (see [en.toml](i18n/en.toml), for example). If the parameter `no_translation` is set to true, than the URL is not adapted to contain the current language code. This is needed for external links or something like the `sitemap.xml` in the example, that is not translated within your website.

#### Social Icons

The social icons in the footer can be adapted by setting any of the following variables:

```toml
[extra.social]
codeberg = ""
github = ""
gitlab = ""
stackoverflow = ""
mastodon = ""
linkedin = ""
instagram = ""
youtube = ""
signal = ""
telegram = ""
email = ""
phone = ""
```

For every non-empty variable, the corresponding icon is shown in the footer.

#### Copyright Notice

The copyright notice in the footer can be set by adding the following variable in the configuration:

```toml
[extra.footer]
notice = "This is my <b>copyright</b> notice."
```

HTML can be used there.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## 	:toolbox: Getting Started

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### :bangbang: Prerequisites

You need static site generator (SSG) [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) installed in your machine to use this theme follow their guide on [getting started](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

<!-- Installation -->
### :gear: Installation

Follow zola's guide on [installing a theme](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).
Make sure to add `theme = "DeepThought"` to your `config.toml`

**Check zola version (only 0.9.0+)**
Just to double-check to make sure you have the right version. It is not supported to use this theme with a version under 0.14.1.

<!-- Run Locally -->
### :running: Run Locally

Go into your sites directory and type `zola serve`. You should see your new site at `localhost:1111`.

**NOTE**: you must provide the theme options variables in `config.toml` to serve a functioning site

<!-- Deployment -->
### :triangular_flag_on_post: Deployment

[Zola](https://www.getzola.org) already has great documentation for deploying to [Netlify](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/netlify/) or [Github Pages](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/). I won't bore you with a regurgitated explanation.

<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

Following options are available with the `DeepThought` theme

```toml
# Enable external libraries
[extra]
katex.enabled = true
katex.auto_render = true

chart.enabled = true
mermaid.enabled = true
galleria.enabled = true

navbar_items = [
 { code = "en", nav_items = [
  { url = "$BASE_URL/", name = "Home" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/posts", name = "Posts" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/docs", name = "Docs" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories" },
 ]},
]

# Add links to favicon, you can use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate favicon for your site
[extra.favicon]
favicon_16x16 = "/icons/favicon-16x16.png"
favicon_32x32 = "/icons/favicon-32x32.png"
apple_touch_icon = "/icons/apple-touch-icon.png"

[extra.commenting]
disqus = "<your_disqus_shortname>"

# To enable mapbox maps
[extra.mapbox]
enabled = true
access_token = "<your_access_token>"
```

#### Multilingual Navbar

If you want to have a multilingual navbar on your blog, you must add your new code language in the [languages](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/#configuration) array in the `config.toml` file.

**NOTE**: Don't add you default language to this array

```toml
languages = [
    {code = "fr"},
    {code = "es"},
]
```

And then create and array of nav item for each language:

**NOTE**: Include your default language in this array

```toml
navbar_items = [
 { code = "en", nav_items = [
  { url = "$BASE_URL/", name = "Home" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/posts", name = "Posts" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/docs", name = "Docs" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories" },
 ]},
 { code = "fr", nav_items = [
  { url = "$BASE_URL/", name = "Connexion" },
 ]},
 { code = "es", nav_items = [
  { url = "$BASE_URL/", name = "Publicationes" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/", name = "Registrar" },
 ]}
]
```

### KaTeX math formula support

This theme contains math formula support using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/),
which can be enabled by setting `katex.enabled = true` in the `extra` section
of `config.toml`.

After enabling this extension, the `katex` short code can be used in documents:

- `{{/* katex(body="\KaTeX") */}}` to typeset a math formula inlined into a text,
  similar to `$...$` in LaTeX
- `{%/* katex(block=true) */%}\KaTeX{%/* end */%}` to typeset a block of math formulas,
  similar to `$$...$$` in LaTeX

#### Automatic rendering without short codes

Optionally, `\\( \KaTeX \\)` / `$ \KaTeX $` inline and `\\[ \KaTeX \\]` / `$$ \KaTeX $$`
block-style automatic rendering is also supported, if enabled in the config
by setting `katex.auto_render = true`.

### Elasticlunr search in other language

Zola use [Elasticlunr.js](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js) to add full-text search feature.
To use languages other than en (English), you need to add some javascript files. See the Zola's issue [#1349](https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/1349).
By placing the `templates/base.html`on your project and using the `other_lang_search_js` block, you can load the required additional javascript files in the right timing.

e.g. `templates/base.html`

```html
{%/* extends "DeepThought/templates/base.html" */%} {%/* block other_lang_search_js */%}
<script src="{{/* get_url(path='js/lunr.stemmer.support.js') */}}"></script>
<script src="{{/* get_url(path='js/tinyseg.js') */}}"></script>
<script src="{{/* get_url(path='js/lunr.' ~ lang ~ '.js') */}}"></script>
<script src="{{/* get_url(path='js/search.js') */}}"></script>
{%/* endblock */%}
```

More detailed explanations are aound in [elasticlunr's documents](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js#other-languages-example-in-browser).

**Demo: [docsascode.codeandmedia.com](http://docsascode.codeandmedia.com)**

I was inspired by [Linode's approach](https://www.linode.com/2020/01/17/docs-as-code-at-linode/) to creating and managing docs. They call it _docs as code methodology._  Thereby my aim was making simple and productive way to work with any sort of documents and articles through Markdown, Git and Docker/k8s optionally. 

The repo contains a theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) (the best static site generator I've ever seen) and dockerfile for building Docker images with Nginx-alpine.  You can pull to your Docker an [image with demo-content](https://hub.docker.com/r/codeandmedia/docsascode-theme)

```
codeandmedia/docsascode-theme:latest
```

If you would use Docker on MacBook M1 processors \ Raspberry Pi4 64bit \ Amazon Graviton or another ARM64 - just fork the ARM64 branch or push

```
codeandmedia/docsascode-theme-arm64:latest
```

## Perks

* light / dark switcher
* tags and authors taxonomies by default
* search
* useful UI both on mobiles and desktops 

## 6 steps build your knowledge base/docs repo

1. Fork the repo 
2. delete demo content and add your own (I explain how to structure it below) 
3. change website name and domain in config.toml, also, change the title in _index.md in a root
4. connect your repo to dockerhub 
5. build your docker image or setup [autobuilds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/)
6. host a builded docker image on your own way

But, zola is amazing static site generator, so you feel free to

1. download all repo files
2. again delete demo content and add your own
3. change name and domain in config.toml/index.md
4. setup zola (win, linux, mac)
5. execute zola build
6. host builded html-output anywhere you want

Zola supports Netlify and other similar services, or you can decide to create your own CI/CD process. 

## How to structure your content

All your articles should be inside _content_ folder. Any images, videos, other static files should be inside _static._ 

### Folders

Every folder should contains _index.md like 

```toml
+++
title = "Docsascode title"
description = "Description is optional"
sort_by = "date" # sort by weight or date
insert_anchor_links = "right" # if you want § next to headers
+++
```
Each folder is the section of the website, it means if you create folder foo it will be seen as _yoursitedomain.com/foo_

The theme supports folders in folders and articles + folders in one folder (see an example inside _content_). So you can store inside folder another folders and describe in index some specific details. 

### Pages 

A page should be started by 

```toml
+++
title = "File and folders in folder"
date = 2020-01-18 # or weight 
description = "Description"
insert_anchor_links = "right"

[taxonomies] #all taxonomies is optional
tags = ["newtag"]
authors = ["John Doe"]
+++
```

Zola allows to create drafts:

```toml 
draft = true
```

Also, by default you have two taxonomies: _tags_ and _authors_. It's optional, not necessary to use it on all pages. And you can add your own taxonomy:

1. Copy tags or authors folder and rename it to your taxonomy
2. Add your taxonomy to config.toml
3. Add to page.html template code like 

```rust
    {%/* if page.taxonomies.yourtaxonomynameplural */%}
      <ul>
      {%/* for tag in page.taxonomies.yourtaxonomynameplural */%}
        <li><a href="{{/* get_taxonomy_url(kind="yourtaxonomynameplural", name=yourtaxonomyname) | safe */}}" >{{/* yourtaxonomyname */}}</a></li>
      {%/* endfor */%}
      </ul>
    {%/* endif */%}
```

Done. I told you Zola is amazing :) 

Anyway you can rewrite theme for your own wishes with Zola ([link to documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/))

![](screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Installation

First install the theme into the `themes` directory with one of these options:

```bash
# If you work with git: 
git submodule add https://github.com/oltdaniel/dose.git themes/dose
# or just do a download:
git clone https://github.com/oltdaniel/dose.git themes/dose
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "dose"
```

You can enable the following taxonomies:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    { name = "tags", feed = true },
]
```

And the theme uses the following extras:

```toml
[extra]
social_media = [
    { name = "GitHub", url = "https://github.com/oltdaniel" },
    { name = "Twitter", url = "https://twitter.com/@twitter" },
    { name = "Mastodon", url = "https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon", rel = "me" }
]
default_theme = "dark" # or "light"
```

The description of yourself with your image, you can modify by using a template. Just create a new
file `myblog/templates/parts/me.html`:

```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/50" height="50px" width="50px">
<p>Hi, this is me. I write about microcontrollers, programming and cloud software. ...</p>
```

If you want to have all pages sorted by their date, please create `myblog/content/_index.md`:
```
+++
sort_by = "date"
+++
```

### About

#### Inspired
I created this theme mainly for my personal website. You are free to use it or modify it. It is inspired by the [`no-style-please`](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/) jekyll theme.

#### Typography

This theme uses no special font, just the browsers default monospace font. Yes, this can mean that the website could be rendered differently, but users can freely choose their webfont.

#### Darkmode

This theme supports dark and light mode. Currently this will be only switched based on the users preffered system theme. But a manual switch will follow in the future in the footer (see the todo).

| light | dark |
|-|-|
| ![](screenshot-light.png) | ![](screenshot-dark.png) |

#### Size

The JavaScript has been moved into the page itself to allow minification. Together this results in the following sizes for the `index.html`:
- `~ 3kB` JavaScript
- `~ 3kB` CSS
- `~ 17kB` Profile Image
- `~5kB - ~3kB = ~2kB` HTML

Which results in a total loading size of `3kB + 3kB + 17kB + 2kB = 25kB`.

#### Syntax Highlighting

As I didn't want to invest any time in creating an own syntax color schema for this theme, I suggest to use `visual-studio-dark`, which is the same one used in the demo page.

#### Customization

You can create your own version of this theme, by simply changing the sass variables in `sass/style.scss` to match your taste.

```scss
/**
 * Variables
 */
$base-background: white;
$text-color: black;
$article-tag: green;
$lang-tag: red;
$link-color: blue;
$target-color: yellow;
$separator-decoration: "//////";
```

![Ergo Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/l182IYg.jpg)

A light, simple & beautiful Zola theme made with a focus on writing. Inspired by sbvtle and Pixyll.

Like both those web designs, Ergo is a theme that emphasizes content, but still tries to be stylish. Frankly, the design is
most like sbvtle (http://sbvtle.com) but without the clever svbtle Engine, Javascript, community or kudos button (kudos is on the list of additions, though! But then i'll have to use JS...)
If you find that you like all those things, please check out [svbtle](http://svbtle.com); this theme is meant as a lighter (free) alternative,
and ergo's design will most likely diverge more in the future as this theme evolves with me and it's users (if there are any).
This is not meant as a svbtle clone.


Here's a timelapse:
[![Ergo Creation Timelapse](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ogEjvM-v_-s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogEjvM-v_-s)


## Installation
Get [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and/or follow their guide on [installing a theme](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).
Make sure to add `theme = "ergo"` to your `config.toml`

Ergo relies on having `paginate_by` variable set in `content/_index.md`.

#### Check zola version (only 0.11.0+)
Just to double-check to make sure you have the right version. It is not supported to use this theme with a version under 0.11.0.

### how to serve
go into your sites directory, and type `zola serve`. You should see your new site at `localhost:1111`.

### Deployment to Github Pages or Netlify
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org) already has great documentation for deploying to [Netlify](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/netlify/) or [Github Pages](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/). I won't bore you with a regurgitated explanation.

### Customizing the Theme
All colors used on the site are from `sass/colors.scss`. There's only about 5-6 colors total.
Change them however you like! Feel free to go into theme and edit the colors. However, editing anything other than `sass/colors.scss` is strongly advised against. Continue at your own peril!

#### Theme Options
```toml
# Specify a profile picture to use for the logos in the theme. It can be svg, png, jpg, whatever, just make sure to copy the logo you want and put it in img/${YOUR_PROFILE}.*
# and update your config.toml accordingly
profile = 'profile.svg'

# Description. This is needed for SEO/site metadata purposes
description = "Simple blog theme focused on writing, inspired by svbtle"

# Color themes used by the theme (theme will use ${color_theme}.css file, generated by SASS or SCSS file with the same name). Defaults to ["default"]. User can choose either of them, default theme is the first in list.
color_themes = ["my-awesome-theme", "default"]

# Even
Even is a clean, responsive theme based on the Hugo theme with the same name featuring categories, tags and pagination.

![even screenshot](https://github.com/getzola/even/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Contents

- Installation
- Options
  - Top menu
  - Title

## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/getzola/even.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "even"
```

The theme requires tags and categories taxonomies to be enabled in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    # You can enable/disable RSS
    {name = "categories", feed = true},
    {name = "tags", feed = true},
]
```
If you want to paginate taxonomies pages, you will need to overwrite the templates
as it only works for non-paginated taxonomies by default.

It also requires to put the posts in the root of the `content` folder and to enable pagination, for example in `content/_index.md`:

```
+++
paginate_by = 5
sort_by = "date"
+++
```

## Options

### Top-menu
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `even_menu`:

```toml
# This is the default menu
even_menu = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL", name = "Home"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/about", name = "About"},
]
```

If you put `$BASE_URL` in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual
site URL.

### Title
The site title is shown on the header. As it might be different from the `<title>`
element that the `title` field in the config represents, you can set the `even_title`
instead.

### KaTeX math formula support

This theme contains math formula support using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/),
which can be enabled by setting `katex_enable = true` in the `extra` section
of `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
katex_enable = true
```

After enabling this extension, the `katex` short code can be used in documents:
* `{{/* katex(body="\KaTeX") */}}` to typeset a math formula inlined into a text,
  similar to `$...$` in LaTeX
* `{%/* katex(block=true) */%}\KaTeX{%/* end */%}` to typeset a block of math formulas,
  similar to `$$...$$` in LaTeX

#### Automatic rendering without short codes

Optionally, `\\( \KaTeX \\)` inline and `\\[ \KaTeX \\]` / `$$ \KaTeX $$`
block-style automatic rendering is also supported, if enabled in the config:

```toml
[extra]
katex_enable = true
katex_auto_render = true
```

# feather
A lightweight blog theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) (and to my knowledge the first of now
many themes created specifically for Zola).

# [Live demo 🔗](https://feather.doomy.org/)

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://feather.doomy.org/)

## Features

- Fully responsive
- Designed for legibility
- All JS is non-critical and fails gracefully

## Options
Zola allows themes to [define `[extra]` variables](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/)
in the config. Here's a full list of theme variables with example values and comments.

```toml
# Regular variables you might want to set...
title = "My site" # Otherwise, this will read "Home" in the nav

[extra.feather]
# Specify a specific theme to use, or use system prefs
# If set, the theme switcher button is hidden
theme = "light"
head = "<script></script>" # add anything to the head
hide_nav_image = false # hide the navigation image
disqus_id = "my-site-com" # site domain if you want disqus comments
cusdis_id = "12312-31231123-123123123" # cusdis id if you use their comment service
social =  { url = "https://mastodon.social/@doomy", display = "@doomy@mastodon.social" } # generic social to show on pages
timezone = "America/New_York" # timezone to calculate article post times

[extra.feather.analytics]
goatcounter_id = "mydomain-com" # privacy-focused analytics https://www.goatcounter.com
```

Per post, these options are available:

```toml
[extra.feather.opengraph]
image = "my_image.jpg" # Assumes asset colocation
```

# Usage
Using feather is easy.  Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and follow
[the guide for creating a site and using a theme](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).  Then,
add `theme = "feather"` to your `config.toml` file.

If you intend to publish your site to GitHub Pages, please check out [this
tutorial](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/).

You can specify `tags` taxonomies .

# Developing & Contributing
Because feather comes with example content, you can run the theme just like any Zola
blog with `zola serve`.

## 安裝與啟用

在您的 Zola 專案資料夾內：

把 Float 以 Git 子模組的方式加入專案內：

```sh
git submodule add https://gitlab.com/float-theme/float.git themes/float
```

編輯您的 config.toml，指定 Float 作為佈景主題：

```toml
theme = "float"
```

編輯您的 config.toml，加入 tags 作為分類系統：

```toml
taxonomies = [
    {name = "tags", paginate_by = 10},
]
```

複製 float/static/ 的所有子資料夾與檔案到您的 static/：

```sh
cp -r themes/float/static/* static/
```

複製 float/content/ 的所有子資料夾與檔案到您的 content/：

```sh
cp -r themes/float/content/* content/
```

## 使用 Float

### 文章與配圖

文章皆以資料夾的方式存在，如下例：

```
content/
└── blog/
    └── 2020/
        └── 2020-06-15-Zola-Theme-Float/
            ├── index.md
            ├── pic1.png
            ├── pic2.png
            └── qa_report.pdf
```

文章為 index.md，文內的配圖或其它檔案也是放在文章資料夾內。

### Front-matter

Front-matter 請參照下列註解說明：

```toml
title = "Float theme for Zola"
description = "Float features and usage guide"
draft = false
[taxonomies]
tags = ["Float", "Zola"]
[extra]
feature_image = "pic1.png" # 卡片圖片。
feature = true # 是否為重點文章，重點文章會以寬版卡片顯示。
link = "" # 指定卡片連結，若有指定則卡片不會連結到文章頁。
```

## 客製化

可客製化設定大多可以在 config.toml 的 `[extra]` 區段做設定：

```toml
[extra]
main_section = "blog"

copyright = ""

web_fonts = "<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif+TC:wght@500;700&display=swap'>"

google_analytics = false
# google_analytics_id = "UA-XXXXXX-X"

google_adsense = false
# google_adsense_id = "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

twitter_account = "@xxx"

likecoin = false
# likecoin_name = "xxx"

utterances = false
# utterances_repo = "xxx/xxx"
```

### 字體

字體的 CSS 位於 float/sass/font.scss，欲更換字體，把 float/sass/font.scss 複製到自己的 sass/font.scss，並修改之。

## 已知問題

- 分頁設定皆須設為 10 篇分頁。因為 Zola 的 `get_section()` 無法取得該 section 的分頁設定。

# Hallo

> A single-page theme to introduce yourself.
>
> [Zola][zola] port of [hallo-hugo][hallo-hugo].

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Original

This is a port of the original [hallo-hugo][hallo-hugo] theme for Hugo ([License][upstream-license]).

## Installation

The easiest way to install this theme is to either clone it ...

```
git clone https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-hallo.git themes/hallo
```

... or to use it as a submodule.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-hallo.git themes/hallo
```

Either way, you will have to enable the theme in your `config.toml`.

```toml
theme = "hallo"
```

### Introduction

The introduction text is made in `content/_index.md`.

## Options

See [`config.toml`][config] for an example configuration.

### Author

The given name will be used for the 'I am ...' text.

Default: `Hallo`

```toml
[extra.author]
name = "Hallo"
```

### Greeting

The string will be used as a greeting.

Default: `Hello!`

```toml
[extra]
greeting = "Hello!"
```

### `iam`

This variable defines the `I am` text, which you may want to swap out for another language.

Default: `I am`

```toml
[extra]
iam = "I am"
```

### Links

Links show up below the introduction. They are styled with [Font Awesome][fontawesome], you may optionally choose the iconset (default is [brands][fontawesome-brands]).

```toml
[extra]
links = [
    { title = "E-Mail", url = "mailto:mail@example.org", iconset = "fas", icon = "envelope" },
    { title = "GitHub", url = "https://github.com", icon = "github" },
    { title = "Twitter", url = "https://twitter.com", icon = "twitter" }
]
```

### Theme

Change the colors used.

```toml
[extra.theme]
background = "#6FCDBD"
foreground = "#FFF" # text and portrait border
hover = "#333" # link hover
```

# HayFlow - Modular Zola Theme

## About

<div align="center">
![Preview screenshot](https://gitlab.com/cyril-marpaud/hayflow/-/raw/main/screenshot.png "Preview screenshot")
</div>

[HayFlow](https://gitlab.com/cyril-marpaud/hayflow) is a modular landing page made as a theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), a static site generator written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). It features a dark theme with a particles background, vertical arrows for navigation and a few card types which you are free to include to best suit your needs. Nearly all UI elements are subtly animated to convey a professional look (although I'm no designer 🤷 merely an [embedded systems engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyrilmarpaud)).

It has been designed to require only [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) editing (no HTML/CSS), but feel free to do so if you need to. I'll be glad to review a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/cyril-marpaud/hayflow/-/merge_requests) if you implement a new card type !

[[_TOC_]]

## Live demo

See [my personal website](https://cyril-marpaud.gitlab.io) for an example of what can be accomplished in a few minutes with this theme. Its source code is also available as an example in my [Gitlab website repository](https://gitlab.com/cyril-marpaud/cyril-marpaud.gitlab.io).

## Built with

- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org)
- [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [Modern Normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)
- Inspiration came from [particle-zola](https://github.com/svavs/particle-zola), another theme.

## Quick start

Initialize a Zola website and install HayFlow:
```bash
zola init mywebsite
cd mywebsite
git clone git@gitlab.com:cyril-marpaud/hayflow.git themes/hayflow
```

Add `theme = "hayflow"` at the top of `config.toml` file to tell Zola to use HayFlow (as described in [the documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/)).

Finally, run...

```bash
zola serve
```
...and go to [http://localhost:1111](http://localhost:1111) to see the landing page in action with the default name displayed (John Doe).

## Landing page customization

Customizing the landing page boils down to two things:

- adding the `name` and `links` variables to the `config.toml`'s `[extra]` section (`links` is optional. So is `name` if your name is John Doe)
- adding the `roles` variable to the `content/_index.md`'s `[extra]` section (also optional)

The difference comes from the fact that you might need to translate the `roles` into other languages. For that to be possible, they must be placed in a MarkDown file. See multilingual support for more info.

- `name` speaks for itself.
- `roles` is an array of strings. Each string is displayed on a separate line.
- `links` is an array of `{icon, url}` objects. You can use any **free** icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free) here, all you need is the icon's code. The [enveloppe icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/envelope?s=solid&f=classic)'s code is `fa-solid fa-envelope`. The [pizza-slice icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/pizza-slice?s=solid&f=classic)'s code is `fa-solid fa-pizza-slice`.

This is what the `config.toml`'s `[extra]` section might look like after customization:

```TOML
[extra]
name = { first = "ninja", last = "turtle" }

links = [
   { icon = "fa-solid fa-envelope", url = "mailto:slice@pizza.it" },
   { icon = "fa-solid fa-pizza-slice", url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza" },
]
```

And here's a customized version of `content/_index.md`:

```TOML
+++
[extra]
roles = ["Green 🟢", "Turtle 🐢", "Pizza enthusiast 🍕"]
+++
```

## Adding a section

Inside the `content` directory, create a `pizza` folder and place this `_index.md` file inside:

```TOML
+++
title = "Pizza"
+++

What a mouthful !
```

Then, add this `sections` variable (an array of strings) to the `config.toml`'s `[extra]` section:

```TOML
[extra]
sections = ["pizza"]
```

A new internal link pointing to that section will appear on the landing page. Click it and see what happens ! This is called a "simple card" section.

## Customizing sections

HayFlow currently supports three card types : `simple`, `columns` and `list`. If left unspecified, the type will default to `simple`. To change it, add a `card_type` variable to the `_index.md`'s `[extra]` section:

```TOML
+++
title = "Pizza"

[extra]
card_type = "simple"
+++

What a mouthful !
```

### Columns card

Add a new section and set its card type to `columns`. Then, alongside the `_index.md` file, create three other files: `one.md`, `two.md` and `three.md`. These will be the ingredients of your new pizza. Their content is similar to `_index.md`:

```TOML
+++
title = "Tomato"

[extra]
icons = ["fa-solid fa-tomato"]
+++

The basis of any self-respecting pizza. It is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum.
```

The `icons` variable is optional.

### List card

Add a new section and set its card type to `list`. Then, alongside the `_index.md` file, create three other files: `one.md`, `two.md` and `three.md`. These will be your favourite pizzas. Their content is similar to `_index.md`:

```TOML
+++
title = "Margherita"

[extra]
link = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Margherita"
+++

Margherita pizza is a typical [Neapolitan pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza), made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and extra-virgin olive oil.
```

The `link` variable is optional.

## Multilingual support

HayFlow supports multilingual websites out of the box.

### Declare more languages

In `config.toml`, add the languages you want to support like so:

```TOML
default_language = "fr"
[translations]
flag = "🇫🇷"

[languages.en]
[languages.en.translations]
flag = "🇬🇧"

[languages.italian]
[languages.italian.translations]
flag = "🇮🇹"
```

This will make the language-select block in the top-right corner visible. It consists of clickable links to the translated versions of your website.
The `flag` variable is optional and you can use simple text instead of an emoji flag. If left unspecified, it will default to the country code you chose for that language (`fr`, `en` and `italian` in this example).

### Translate the content

Each `.md` file in the `content` folder now needs to be translated into every additional language previously declared in `config.toml`.

Following the above example (three languages, french, english and italian) and given this initial filetree:

```
content/
   _index.md
   pizzas/
      _index.md
      margherita.md
      capricciosa.md
```

The final filetree should look like this for the translation to be complete:

```
content/
   _index.md
   _index.en.md
   _index.italian.md
   pizzas/
      _index.md
      _index.en.md
      _index.italian.md
      margherita.md
      margherita.en.md
      margherita.italian.md
      capricciosa.md
      capricciosa.en.md
      capricciosa.italian.md
```

### List cards

Additionally, if your website includes any "list card" sections, you might want to specify a `discover` variable in their `[extra]` sections like so:

```TOML
+++
title = "List Card Section"

[extra]
card_type = "list"
discover = "Découvrir"
+++
```

# hephaestus
Hephaestus is a portfolio theme for zola. It uses bulma css and supports using icons from ion-icon.

![hephaestus screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Contents
- Installation
- Options
	- Navigation Bar
	- Education
	- Projects
	- Skills
	- Social Links

## Installation

First, you will download the theme into your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/BConquest/hephaestus
```

Second, you will enable the theme in your `config.toml` directory:

```toml
theme = "hephaestus"
```

## Options
### Navigation Bar
To edit the navigation bar you will need to edit your `config.toml` to include:

```toml
menu = [
{ text = "foo", link = "/foo"},
{ text = "bar", link = "/bar"},
]
```
You can have as many items as you want to have and the links can be to anything.

### Education
To edit the education that is displayed you will need to create a directory in `content`.
In the `_index.md` the frontmatter needs to include:

```TOML
title = "foo"
template = "education.html"

[extra]
author = "Name"
```

For every educational level you want to add you will need to create a new markdown file that includes the frontmatter:

```
title = "place of education"

[extra]
image = "image-location"
link = "link to school"
+++
```

Any content that is typed will be rendered underneath these two items.

### Projects
To edit the projects that are displayed you will need to create a directory in `content`.
In the `_index.md` the frontmatter needs to include:

```TOML
title = "foo"
template = "projects.html"

[extra]
author = "bar"
```

Then for every project you want to add you will need to format the `*.md` as:

```md
+++
title = "foo"

[extra]
image = "/image_location"
link = "link to project"
technologies = ["bar", "baz"]
+++

Description of project named foo.
```

### Skills

To edit the skills that you want to display it is important to note that there are two types of skills that can be
displayed (lan, and tools). To format the look you will need to create a directory in `content` that includes the
frontmatter of:

```TOML
title = "foo"
template = "skills.html"
page_template = "skills.html"

[extra]
author = "author-name"
image = "image-location"

lan = [
{ lang = "language", expr = "num between 1-5", image = "image-location", comfort = "word to describe comfort"},
]

tools = [
{ tool = "tool-name", expr = "num between 1-5", image = "tool-image"},
]
```

### Social Links
To edit the social links that appear in the footer of the page, you need to edit your `config.toml` to include:

```
social = [
{ user = "username", link = "link", icon = "icon-name from ion-icon"},
]
```

   - [自定义](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/)

1. 参考定制主页章节，根据需要修改`config.toml`配置文件内容，您需要对 TOML 格式有基本的了解。

1. 根据需要将自己的图片素材放到`static/img`文件夹

## 正式使用

本章节提供的方案和直接修改本仓库代码的最大区别就是内容隔离。基于 Zola 博客框架的机制，将本仓库的代码安装为主题，这样主题更新和用户自己的修改将完全隔离，能够长期使用，避免产生技术债务。

正式使用时，假定你已经对 [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) 框架和 Git Submodule 具备基础的了解，具体操作步骤如下：

1. 本地安装 Zola 命令行工具，参考[官方说明](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
1. 使用 `zola` 命令行本地初始化一个新的网站，也就是你的个人主页，并初始化为 Git 仓库。命令格式为`zola init <site name>`
1. 将本主题仓库作为 Git Submodule 安装在你的网站
   ```bash
   git submodule add -b main https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang/Homepage-Creators themes
   ```
   此时，你的仓库应该自动创建了`themes/Homepage-Creators`文件夹
1. 下载本仓库内容
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init
   ```
   此时，`themes/Homepage-Creators`文件夹应该具有内容了
2. 配置新网站使用本主题，修改`config.toml`文件的属性`theme = "Homepage-Creators"`
3. 参考定制主页章节，根据需要修改`config.toml`配置文件内容，您需要对 TOML 格式有基本的了解。

之后，你的个人主页网站就可以作为一个单独的 Git 仓库维护管理了。

如果需要更新主题，只需要更新 Git Submodule 的分支/标签/代码即可。

## 定制主页

定制过程十分简单！无需改一行代码，因为我已经对板块进行模块化抽取，你只需要：

1. 将使用到的图片素材并存放在`static/img`文件夹（最费时且最难的工作其实是图片制作……）
2. 修改 `config.toml` 文件，配置板块、文字内容和引用的图片
3. 运行`zola serve`命令，本地预览主页，支持实时刷新

要进行主页定制，你需要对 Zola 框架具有基本的了解，例如[理解项目结构](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/)和[配置文件](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/)，这些内容十分简单，只需要通读一遍即可。

### 基础配置

在 `config.toml` 文件中可以对网站信息进行设置，说明如下

```toml
[extra.site]
# 建站年份，用于底部版权内容生成
start_year = 2024
# 网站 Logo
logo = "/img/logo.webp"
# 导航栏 Logo，留空则默认为网站 Logo
nav_logo = "/img/logo.webp"
# 联系邮箱
mail = "contact@example.com"
# ICP 备案号
compliance_icp = "ICP备XXXXXXXX号"
# 公安备案号
compliance_security = "公网安备0000000000号"
# 公安备案链接
compliance_security_link = "https://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/registerSystemInfo?recordcode=0000000000"

[extra.other]
# 是否启用 AVIF 图片格式转换，大幅降低图片尺寸
avif_enable = true
```

### 导航菜单

在 `config.toml` 文件中可以对**顶部导航栏**和**通知**的内容进行设置，说明如下

```toml
[extra.nav]

# 导航栏下方弹出通知
[extra.nav.message]
enable = true
# support inline html
text = "🎉 访问作者博客"
url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang"

# 中间导航栏配置
[extra.nav.center]
menus = [
    # 设置 internal = true，url 为文字的表示内部导航，页面滑动到特定板块的区域
    { name = "主页", url = "主页", internal = true},
    { name = "主题", url = "主题", internal = true},
    { name = "博客", url = "博客", internal = true},
    { name = "媒体", url = "媒体", internal = true},
    # 设置 internal = true，url 为链接的表示外部跳转
    { name = "项目", url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang/tags/project/", internal = false},
]

# 右侧导航栏配置
[extra.nav.right]
menus = [
    { name = "作者博客", url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang", internal = false},
    { name = "作者 Github", url = "https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang", internal = false},
]
```

### 内容板块

你可以根据需求对板块进行灵活定制，除了顶部导航栏之外，页面的任何板块都是**模块化组件**，可以**无限自定义顺序、数量**，随心所需，做你所想！

板块的使用十分简单，将**板块的配置代码粘贴在 `config.toml` 的最后部分**，也就是 `[extra.other]` Section 的后面即可。配置代码的第一行统一为 `[[extra.index.widgets]]`，`[[ ]]`在 Toml 语法中表示数组的意思

**板块的顺序和添加的顺序一致**，也就是说，你可以在 `config.toml` 文件中通过复制粘贴调整代码顺序以达到控制页面展示顺序的目的。

如果有疑惑的地方，最快的方法是参考本项目的 [config.toml 文件](https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang/Homepage-Creators/blob/main/config.toml)，相信你会有所收获。

目前支持的模块化组件如下：

#### 模块化组件板块：首屏内容

配置代码

```toml
[[extra.index.widgets]]
# 重要，不要修改
type = "header"
[extra.index.widgets.value]
title_1 = "大标题1"
title_2 = "大标题2"
bio_1 = "这行描述有<span class=\"inline-word\">高亮文字</span>"
bio_2 = "另一行描述"
# “了解更多”按钮的链接
about_url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang/about/"
# 右侧的图片
cover = "/img/logo.svg"
# 下面是“了解更多”按钮旁边的小按钮，可根据需求增删，通常放社交媒体链接
[[extra.index.widgets.value.links]]
class_icon = " icon-github-line"
url = "https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang"
[[extra.index.widgets.value.links]]
class_icon = " icon-github-line"
url = "https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang"
```

截图（仅展示比较美观的效果，可能和配置代码内容无关）

![首屏内容截图](./docs/header.png)

#### 模块化组件板块：作者介绍

配置代码

```toml
[[extra.index.widgets]]

# Hook

A clean and simple personal site/blog theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org).

[Demo](https://inputusername.github.io/zola-hook/)

## Setup

Clone this repo into your `themes` folder:
```sh
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/InputUsername/zola-hook.git hook
```

Then, enable it in your `config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "hook"
```

## Features

The following templates are built-in:
- `index.html` - the homepage;
- `page.html` - pages and posts (extends `index.html`);
- `section.html` - archive of pages in a section, mostly for a blog (extends `page.html`);
- `404.html` - 404 page (extends `page.html`).

Templates have the following Tera blocks:
- `title` - to override the default `<title>` (`config.title`);
- `description` - to override the `<meta name="description">`'s content (`config.description`);
- `extra_head` - to override styles and anything else in `<head>`;
- `header` - to change the header (best to put this in a `<header>`);
- `content` - to change the content (best to put this in a `<main>`).

You can set a section or page description using `description` in your front matter.
By default, the `description` in `config.toml` is used.

You can define links to include in the header on the homepage in `config.toml`:
```toml
[extra]

links = [
    { title = "Link display text", href = "http://example.com" },
    # ...
]
```

Pages in the root section can define `extra.in_header = true` to be included in the header links on the homepage.

The content in the root `_index.md` is included in the homepage if present.

Below that is a list of the 20 most recent posts. For this, the `blog/_index.md` section is expected to exist
(will error if it doesn't exist). There is also a link to an archive of all blog posts by year.

Hook supports light/dark mode based on the user's preference. There is also a manual toggle button
(requires JavaScript).

# hyde
Hyde is a brazen two-column [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) based on the Jekyll theme of the same name that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content.

![Hyde screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1831228/42af6c6a-7384-11e3-98fb-e0b923ee0468.png)


## Contents

- Installation
- Options
  - Sidebar menu
  - Sticky sidebar content
  - Themes
  - Reverse layout

## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/getzola/hyde.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "hyde"
```

## Options

### Sidebar menu
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `hyde_links`:
```toml
[extra]
hyde_links = [
    {url = "https://google.com", name = "Google.com"},
    {url = "https://google.fr", name = "Google.fr"},
]
```
Each link needs to have a `url` and a `name`.

### Sticky sidebar content
By default Hyde ships with a sidebar that affixes it's content to the bottom of the sidebar. You can optionally disable this by setting `hyde_sticky` to false in your `config.toml`.

### Themes
Hyde ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

![Hyde in red](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1831229/42b0b354-7384-11e3-8462-31b8df193fe5.png)

There are eight themes available at this time.

![Hyde theme classes](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1817044/e5b0ec06-6f68-11e3-83d7-acd1942797a1.png)

To use a theme, set the `hyde_theme` field in `config.toml` to any of the themes name:

```toml
[extra]
hyde_theme = "theme-base-08"
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/public/css/hyde.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

![Hyde with reverse layout](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1831230/42b0d3ac-7384-11e3-8d54-2065afd03f9e.png)

Hyde's page orientation can be reversed by setting `hyde_reverse` to `true` in the `config.toml`.

# Zola-Inky

> An elegant and understated theme for Zola

Zola Inky ([view demo](https://jimmyff.github.io/zola-inky)) is a theme by [jimmyff](https://github.com/jimmyff) and [mr-karan](https://github.com/mr-karan) for the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator. This theme was originally based on the [hugo-ink](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink) theme, ported by mr-karan. It was then packaged and developed further by jimmyff. The theme is available on [Github](https://github.com/jimmyff/zola-inky) under the MIT license, for more information on how to use it please see the [readme](https://github.com/jimmyff/zola-inky/blob/main/README.md) and check the [changelog](https://github.com/jimmyff/zola-inky/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of the latest changes.

[![PNG](screenshot.png)](https://jimmyff.github.io/zola-inky)

## Changelog

For latest changes please see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

- Responsive design
- Responsive images
- Gallery template
- Taxonomy support
- Search
- Customisable via template hooks

## Getting started

1. Add this theme to your `themes/` folder (recommended method: git submodule).
2. Copy of the the theme's config.toml file and put in your projects root directory. Update it as required and don't forget to add `theme = 'zola-inky'` at the top of the file.
3. Copy this contents of the `content/` directory the root of your project and change the files as your necessary.

## Customising the theme

- __To change the settings__ copy `config.toml` in to your project and update as required (make sure you add the theme variable at the top of the file, see the getting started heading above).
- __To change the themes colours__ copy `sass/variables.scss` in to your project under the same folder and update as required.
- __To inject content in to templates__ copy `templates/macros/hooks.html` and update as required.

## Using the responsive image shortcode

Using the responsive images will make sure your images are generated at various sizes and served up to viewers at the size that best suits their device via the image srcset attribute. You can use this feature in your markdown like so:

```md
{{/* image(src="yourimage.jpg", alt="This is my image") */}}
```

## Feature requests & support

I'm afraid I'm unable to accept feature requests or provide user support for this theme. The [Zola documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) and [Tera documentation](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/) are great resources and there is a [Zola discussion forum](https://zola.discourse.group/). If you've found a bug in the themse please open a github issue.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you are planning to add a feature to the theme then feel free to open an issue to discuss your approach and we will be able to say if it's it will likely be accepted. Please keep the following in mind:

- Only widely generic features will be accepted, anything too specific should be kept to your own templates.
- Be careful about destroying indentation as Tera syntax doesn't seem to be widely supported by IDEs.
- Keep it lean. Adding bloat will likely result in your PR being rejected.
- Consider backward compatibility, ideally people blindly-upgrading won't see any unexpected changes to their sites.

New theme maintainers are welcome but should provide pull-request or two first!

# Juice

<img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="/content/juice.svg">

**Juice** is an intuitive, elegant, and responsive Zola theme for product sites.

- Build for product sites
- Simple and intuitive structure
- Clean and elegant design
- Responsive and mobile device compatible
- Customize and extend friendly

https://juice.huhu.io

# Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/huhu/juice.git
```

or add as a submodule
```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/huhu/juice  themes/juice
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "juice"
```

# Structure

### Hero

**Juice** is designed for product websites, hence we let **hero** part fills whole of screen.
You can customize your **hero** by using `hero` block in the `templates/index.html`.

```html
{%/* extends "juice/templates/index.html" */%}
{%/* block hero */%}
    <div>
        Your cool hero html...
    </div>
{%/* endblock hero */%}
```

### Page

Every markdown file located in `content` directory will become a **Page**. There also will display as
a navigate link on the top-right corner.
You can change the frontmatter's `weight` value to sort the order (ascending order).

```
+++
title = "Changelog"
description = "Changelog"
weight = 2
+++

```

### CSS variables

You can override theme variable by creating a file named `_variables.html` in your `templates` directory.

See the default value [here](./templates/_variables.html)

### Favicon
The same way as changing the `hero` block in the `templates/index.html`, you can change the **favicon**.

```html
{%/* extends "juice/templates/index.html" */%}
{%/* block favicon */%}
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.ico">
{%/* endblock favicon */%}
```

### Fonts
If you changed the `--xy-font-family`-variable in `_variables.html`, you have to load the mentioned fonts in the `templates/index.html`.

```html
{%/* extends "juice/templates/index.html" */%}
{%/* block fonts */%}
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fork-awesome@1.2.0/css/fork-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Babylonica&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
{%/* endblock fonts */%}
```

# Configuration

You can customize some builtin property in `config.toml` file:

```toml
[extra]
juice_logo_name = "Juice"
juice_logo_path = "juice.svg"
juice_extra_menu = [
    { title = "Github", link = "https://github.com/huhu/juice"}
]
juice_exclude_menu = [
    "exclude_from_nav"
]
repository_url = "https://github.com/huhu/juice"
```

# Shortcodes

**Juice** have some builtin shortcodes available in `templates/shortcodes` directory.

- `issue(id)` - A shortcode to render issue url, e.g. `issue(id=1)` would render to the link `https://github.com/huhu/juice/issue/1`.
  
> The `repository_url` is required.

# kangae (考え, idea or thought)

[kangae][1] is a lightweight microblog theme for [zola][2].

<details>
  <summary>kangae screenshots on desktop and mobile</summary>

  ![kangae screenshot light mode on mobile](static/images/kangae-mobile-light.webp)
  ![kangae screenshot dark mode on mobile](static/images/kangae-mobile-dark.webp)
</details>

I've created kangae from scratch and it is not based on any other theme. However, I was inspired to
create kangae after I came across [Wolfgang Müller's microblog][3]. Thanks Wolf!

kangae is licensed under the [NCSA license][5], which is quite similar to the BSD-3-Clause license.
Unlike BSD-3-Clause, NCSA also covers documentation of a project.

# Showcase

Here's a list of websites using the kangae theme

- [ayushnix microblog][4]

If you want to mention your website in this section, please raise a pull request.

# Installation

Before using this theme, [install zola][6]. After you've installed zola,

```
$ zola init microblog
> What is the URL of your site? (https://example.com):
> Do you want to enable Sass compilation? [Y/n]:
> Do you want to enable syntax highlighting? [y/N]:
> Do you want to build a search index of the content? [y/N]:
$ cd microblog/
```

kangae doesn't use Sass or syntax highlighting so if you don't want to use custom Sass code or
enable syntax highlighting, answer the 2nd and 3rd question with a 'no'. kangae also doesn't use any
JavaScript library to search content. If you don't intend to install a JavaScript library to enable
search on your microblog, answer 'no' to the last question as well.

If you intend to publish your microblog on a forge like GitHub, initialize an empty git repository
using

```
$ git init
$ git commit --allow-empty -m 'initial empty root commit'
```

If you don't want to make an empty commit, add and commit a README or a LICENSE file instead.

At this point, you can install kangae using one of the following methods

## using `git subtree`

```
$ git subtree add -P themes/kangae/ --squash https://github.com/ayushnix/kangae.git master
```

## using `git submodule`

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/ayushnix/kangae.git themes/kangae
```

## download kangae in themes directory

If you want to keep things simple and figure out version control later, you can

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ayushnix/kangae.git themes/kangae
```

# Configuration

To begin using kangae after installing it,

```
$ cp themes/kangae/config.toml ./
$ sed -i 's;# theme =\(.*\);theme =\1;' config.toml
```

The [`config.toml`][7] file of kangae has been documented carefully using TOML comments. If you have
any questions about configuring kangae which haven't been answered in the `config.toml` file itself,
please [raise an issue][8].

## Shortcodes

kangae provides several shortcodes that can be used to add content in an accessible manner

### kaomoji `(・_・)ノ`

If you want to use kaomoji in your posts, you can use insert them in an accessbile manner using

```
I don't know. {{/* kaomoji(label="shrug kaomoji", text="╮( ˘_˘ )╭") */}} I've never thought about it.
```

Providing a value for the `label` is optional but highly recommended. A short text should be
mentioned that explains what the kaomoji means to convey. The value of `text` should be the actual
emoticon itself.

This shortcode can also be used for any other ASCII emoticon that can fit in an inline paragraph.
This includes western emoticons such as `;)` and combination emoticons such as `<(^_^<)`.

### Quotes

You can add quotes in your microblog posts using

```
{%/* quote(author="Nara Shikamaru") */%}
You would think just this once, when it was life or death, I could pull through.
{%/* end */%}
```

This is the most basic form of improvement in writing quotes over simply using `>` in markdown.

If you want to mention the name of the source from where the quote has been taken, such as the name
of the book or a movie, you can use

```
{%/* quote(citation="Mass Effect 3", author="Javik") */%}
Stand in the ashes of a trillion dead souls, and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer.
{%/* end */%}
```

A `citeurl` can also be given as an argument to this shortcode to provide the actual URL from where
the source is borrowed.

```
{%/* quote(author="Edward Snowden", citeurl="https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/crglgh2/") */%}
Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
{%/* end */%}
```

A live preview of these how these shortcodes look like can be found on [this blog post][14].

## Optional Features

kangae includes some optional features that aren't enabled by default

- [style external links using a ↗ unicode symbol][11]

# Notes

Although I'm not a web developer, I am interested in learning HTML and CSS to create lightweight
textual websites. You may be interested in reading [my log about how I learned HTML and CSS][12].
However, that page is just an unorganized dump of my thoughts and isn't a polished blog post.
[Seirdy's blog post on creating textual websites][13] is probably a better reference.

# TODO (maybe?)

- (responsive) image shortcodes
- run prettier on HTML and CSS before deployment
- twitter and mastodon shortcodes
- add optional support for cross posting and commenting on mastodon without using JS
- add optional support for [giscus][9] and [loading mastodon comments][10]
- add shortcode for asciinema
- add shortcode for blockquote and citation
- pagination
- light and dark mode switch
- content tabs
- microdata and microformats2

# Kita

Kita is a clean, elegant and simple blog theme for Zola.

This theme is based on Hugo theme [hugo-paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) with some features added.

[Demo](https://kita-zola.pages.dev)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/st1020/kita/main/screenshot.png)

## Features

- Easy to use and modify
- No preset limits (This theme does not limit your content directory structure, taxonomy names, etc. It's applicable to all zola sites.)
- Inject support
- Dark mode
- Responsive design
- Social icons
- Taxonomies support
- Projects page

- Table of Content
- Admonition shortcode
- SEO friendly
- Comments using [Giscus](https://giscus.app/)
- Mathematical notations using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
- Diagrams and charts using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)

## Installation

The easiest way to install this theme is to clone this repository in the themes directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/st1020/kita.git themes/kita
```

Or to use it as a submodule:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/st1020/kita.git themes/kita
```

Then set `kita` as your theme in `config.toml`.

```toml
theme = "kita"
```

## Configuration

See the `extra` section in [config.toml](https://github.com/st1020/kita/blob/main/config.toml) as a example.

## Inject support

You can easily use inject to add new features to your side without modifying the theme itself.

To use inject, you need to add some HTML files to the `templates/injects` directory.

The available inject points are: `head`, `header_nav`, `body_start`, `body_end`, `page_start`, `page_end`, `footer`, `page_info`.

For example, to load a custom script, you can add a `templates/injects/head.html` file:

```html
<script src="js-file-path-or-cdn-url.js"></script>
```

# Kodama

![Theme screenshot](./screenshot.png)
## Summary

This theme is greatly inspired from hugo academic theme.

First lets introduce some technical details:
- It relies on [zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
- It has no javascript.
- The CSS is built with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
    - The blog articles are themed with [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) theme.


## Getting started

The best way to get started is to follow the official [zola tutorial](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

This theme can be installed as any other theme.

```
mkdir themes
cd themes & git clone https://github.com/adfaure/kodama-theme
```

and set in the `config.toml` the variable `theme` to `kodama-theme`.

### Generate the CSS

[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a framework that parses your html files, and generate the minimal CSS required.
This theme depends on this framework.

The theme comes with the precompiled style files (`static/styles/styles.css`). However, if you wish to change the style, or modify the template htlm, you might need to recompile your styles.

The most simple way, is to follow the [installation page of tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

At the end, you should have tailwindcss installed, and I advise to use the following tailwind configuration:

```js
# tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./templates/**/*.html", "./themes/**/*.html",  "./themes/**/*.html"],
  theme: {},
  variants: {},
  plugins: [
      require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
};
```

Create a file `styles/styles.css`, and use the following command to generate the final CSS file:

```
npx tailwindcss -i styles/styles.css -o static/styles/styles.css
```

The resulting file `static/styles/styles.css` is loaded in the html.

*Note that, for the moment the generation of the css is not automated. As a result, it is necessary to re-run this command when changes are made with the styling.*

## Configuration

This theme use some extra configuration, that can be set in the extra section of your `config.toml`.

```toml
# Title displayed in the index page
title = "Website title"

# Use this theme
theme = "kodama-theme"

[extra]

# Image of your avatar displayed on the landing page
avatar = "static/img/avatar.jpg"
# Image of the favicon
favicon = "static/img/avatar.jpg"

# Your email address showed in the contact section
email = "kodama[at]domain.com"

# If you don't want to show your contact information in the index
contact_in_index = true

# Additional menu items
# `Name` is what it is displayed, `path` is the url
menu_items = [
  { path = "#contacts", name = "Contact" },
]
```

## Index page

The information needed to build the index page are located in the page [front matter](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/#front-matter) of root index file (e.g `content/_index.md`).

The available configuration options are:

```toml
# Insert zola front matter variable such as date etc

[extra]

# Show a concise description of what you do below your avatar.
title = "Concise description"

# The list of interests displayed
interests = [
  "Rainbow pony",
  "Martian food",
  "Quantic science"
]

# The list of your degrees / education
[[extra.education.courses]]
  course = "Latest degree"
  institution = "Some acamedy"
  year = 2020

[[extra.education.courses]]
  course = "Another degree"
  institution = "Here and there"
  year = 2016

# Finally, a list of icons with a link displayed below your avatar
[[extra.avatar_icons]]
  icon = "github"
  link = "https://github.com/adfaure"
[[extra.avatar_icons]]
  icon = "gitlab"
  link = "https://gitlab.com/adfaure"
[[extra.avatar_icons]]
  icon = "linkedin"
  link = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrien-faure-9958978b/"
```
## Contact

The predefined contact page can be use.
The front matter extra part should contains a list of the link to show in the contacts.

## Sections

The section available in your website are automatically detected and displayed in the nav bar at the top of the page.
To prevent a section to be displayed in the nav bar, you can set the extra front matter option `extra.hidden_nav = false` to false.

The section are sorted by `weight` defined in the front matter of the section.

By default, the sections (i.e folders under `content/section_name`) have a summary showed in the index.
This is configurable in the front matter of the section (e.g `content/section_name/_index.md`).

```toml
# The name displayed in the section summary
extra.index_title = "Recent Posts"
# Set to false to remove the section from the index
extra.index_show = true
```

### Blog

The section `blog` is the most standard section. It show a list of article with things that you want to share in your website.
To use the blog template, configure the section with the following front matter:

```toml
template = "section.html"
page_template = "blog-page.html"
```

### Publications

The section `publication` is very similar to the `blog` section however it is dedicated to show your list of scientific articles.
The articles are showed in two subcategories: Thesis and Conference / Workshop.

To configure a publication section (e.g `content/research`) and set the following content:

```md
+++
title = "Research"
sort_by = "date"

# Here the two dedicated templates
template = "publications.html"
page_template = "publication-page.html"

# If you want to show your publications under different sections
# the title will be the displayed text in your website, and the type
# should be the type of publication.
# Each individual plublication has an `extra.type` that refers to the
# publication type (example in content sub-section).
extra.publications_types = [
  { title = "Journal articles", type = "journals" },
  { title = "Thesis", type = "thesis" },
  { title = "Conferences and workshops ", type = "conferences" }
]
+++

## Content

Any content will be displayed on top of the section.
```

Article are referenced in subdirectories of this section.
```
tree content/research
content/research
├── _index.md
├── paper1
│   ├── bib
│   └── index.md
└── thesis
    ├── bib
    ├── index.md
    ├── thesis.pdf
    └── thesis_slides.pdf
```

The bib files are automatically loaded to get information from it. However, it is also possible to add information in the front matter of the article markdown file.

```markdown
+++
title = "Article 1"
date = 2021-05-18

[extra]
type = "Conference"
authors = [ "Kodama Mononoke" ]

# Should be the type of the publication type it should appears under
# configured in the front matter of publications/_index.md
type = "conferences"

featured = true
publication = "2020 IEE rainbow workshop"
# Add full url for your pdf and your presentation
url_pdf = "https://your-pdf"
url_slides = "path_to_slides"

# Add a link to a local pdf inside of your paper folder (example in content/publications/paper1.index.md)
pdf = "paper.pdf"
slides = "path_to_slides.pdf"
+++
```

## Extend the html header

In some cases, it is needed to add extra javascript or css files to be loaded by the web browsers.
The base template of this theme define an empty block named `user_head`.

To use this block, you can just create a new template name `templates/base.html` with the following content:

```html
{%/* extends "kodama-theme/templates/base.html" */%}

{%/* block user_head */%}
  <script>
    console.log("hello world!");
  </script>
{%/* endblock user_head */%}
```

## Icons

The icons available in this project are stored in a dedicated macro function in `templates/macros/icons.html`.
To add a new svg, you can add a case in the `if elif .. else` of the function containing the svg copied from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) for instance.

## Installation
Download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/carpetscheme/lightspeed.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "lightspeed"
```

Posts should be placed directly in the `content` folder.

To sort the post index by date, enable sort in your index section `content/_index.md`:

```toml
sort_by = "date"
```

## Options

### Title
Set a title and description in the config to appear in the site header:

```toml
title = "Different strokes"
description = "for different folks"

```

### Footer-menu
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `footer_links`:

```toml
[extra]

footer_links = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL/about", name = "About"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/atom.xml", name = "RSS"},
    {url = "https://example.com", name = "Example"},
]
```

Create pages such as `$BASE_URL/about` by placing them in a subfolder of the content directory, and specifying the path in the frontmatter:

```toml
path = "about"
```

The footer credit to Zola and Lightspeed can be disabled with the `footer_credits` option.

### Sass

Styles are compiled from sass and imported inline to the header.

You can overide the styles by enabling sass compilation in the config:

```toml
compile_sass = true
```

and placing a replacement `style.scss` file in your sass folder.

cd myblog
git init
```

1. Add the theme as a git submodule:

```sh
git submodule add https://codeberg.org/salif/linkita.git themes/linkita
```

If you don't want to use git submodules, you can clone the repository instead: `git clone https://codeberg.org/salif/linkita.git themes/linkita`

2. Enable the theme in your `config.toml` file:

```toml ,name=config.toml
theme = "linkita"
```

Place it near the `base_url` variable, not under `[extra]`.

## Managing versions

To update the theme, run:

```sh
git submodule update --remote themes/linkita
```

Check the [changelog](https://codeberg.org/salif/linkita/src/branch/linkita/CHANGELOG.md)
for all versions after the one you are using. There may be breaking changes that require manual involvement.

If and only if you use Tailwind classes in your templates directory, run:

```sh
cd themes/linkita
pnpm tailwindcss -i ./src/app.css -o ../../static/main.min.css --minify
```

## Usage

Linkita uses the following front matter variables.
All variables are optional.
Set the ones you need.

### YAML frontmatter

```yaml ,name=frontmatter
---
title: ""
description: ""
date: 
updated: 
taxonomies:
  categories:
  tags:
extra:
  comment: false
  math: false
  mermaid: false
  cover:
    image: ""
    alt: ""
---
```

### TOML frontmatter

```toml ,name=frontmatter
+++
title = ""
description = ""
# The date of the post
date = 2025-12-30
# The last updated date of the post
updated = 2025-12-31

[taxonomies]
categories = []
tags = []

[extra]
# Enable comments
comment = false
# Enable KaTeX support
math = false
# Enable Mermaid support
mermaid = false
[extra.cover]
# Path to the cover image
image = ""
# A description of the cover image
alt = ""
+++
```

### Other extra front matter variables

Linkita supports [more extra variables, listed here](https://salif.github.io/linkita/en/extra-frontmatter/).

### Pages and Posts

#### Home page

Create a `content/_index.md` file and set `extra.profile` to your username:

```toml ,name=content/_index.md
+++
title = ""
description = ""
sort_by = "date"
paginate_by = 4
[extra]
profile = "your_username"
+++
```

Do it for each language in your blog.
For French, the file name is `content/_index.fr.md`.

See Profiles for more.

#### Posts

In the `content` directory, create a subdirectory named `blog` or another name of your choice.

Create a `content/blog/_index.md` file:

```toml ,name=content/blog/_index.md
+++
title = "Archive"
description = ""
template = "archive.html"
transparent = true
[extra]
date_format = "%m-%d"
+++
```

Create a `content/blog/hello.md` file:

```md ,name=content/blog/hello.md
+++
title = "Title"
date = 2025-12-30
+++

Summary <!-- more -->

## Hello, world!
```

#### Pages

The default page template `page.html` is for blog posts.
For pages that are not blog posts you can use the `pages.html` template.

In the `content` directory, create a subdirectory named `pages` and
create a `content/pages/_index.md` file:

```toml ,name=content/pages/_index.md
+++
render = false
page_template = "pages.html"
+++
```

Create a `content/pages/about.md` file:

```md ,name=content/pages/about.md
+++
title = "About me"
description = ""
path = "about"
+++

## Hello, world!
```

If you want, you can also create [a page for your projects](https://salif.github.io/linkita/en/shortcodes/#projects).

### Setting page authors

Choose one of the following options or skip if you don't know what you're doing:

#### Option A: Using `page.authors` and `config.author`

The default author for posts is set using the `author` variable in the `config.toml` file.

You don't need to set `authors` in the front matter if the default author is the only author of the post. Otherwise, set `authors`:

```toml ,name=frontmatter
+++
authors = ["author_username"]
+++
```

#### Option B: Using Taxonomies

Useful if the blog has a team of several authors.
If you choose this option you should set taxonomies in each post.

```toml ,name=frontmatter
+++
[taxonomies]
authors = ["author_username", "author2_username"]
+++
```

### Inject support

You can easily use inject to add new features to your side without modifying the theme itself.

To use inject, you need to add some HTML files to the `templates/injects` directory.

The available inject points are: `head.html`, `head_end.html`, `header_nav.html`,
`body_start.html`, `body_end.html`, `page_start.html`, `page_end.html`, `footer.html`.

For example, you can add JavaScript files and CSS stylesheets in the `templates/injects/head_end.html` file.

## Configuring

Copy and paste the examples into your `config.toml` file
and comment out the variables you don't use instead of setting empty values.
All variables are optional.

```toml ,name=config.toml
# The URL the site will be built for.
base_url = "https://example.com"

# The site theme to use.
theme = "linkita"

# The default language.
# "en" is for English.
default_language = "en"

# The default author for pages.
# See "extra.profiles".
author = "your_username"

# The site title.
# Will be in all page titles.
title = ""

# The site description.
# Used in feeds by default.
description = ""

# Automatically generate a feed.
# Default value: false
generate_feeds = true

# The filenames to use for the feeds.
# e.g. ["rss.xml"]
feed_filenames = ["atom.xml"]

# Build a search index from the pages and section content
# for "default_language".
# build_search_index = true
```

Zola has built-in support for taxonomies.
Linkita has special support for taxonomies named `tags`, `categories`, and `authors`.

```toml ,name=config.toml
[[taxonomies]]
name = "categories"
feed = true
paginate_by = 4

[[taxonomies]]
name = "tags"
feed = true
paginate_by = 4

[[taxonomies]]
name = "authors"
feed = true
paginate_by = 4
```

You can add more languages by replacing `fr` from the following example with the language code:

```toml ,name=config.toml
[languages.fr]
title = "Site title in French"
description = "Site description in French"
generate_feeds = true
feed_filenames = ["atom.xml"] # or ["rss.xml"]
build_search_index = true
taxonomies = [
    { name = "tags", feed = true, paginate_by = 4 }
]
```

By default, taxonomy pages are sorted in descending order by the number of posts.
You can customize this behavior using the `extra.taxonomy_sorting` variable:

```toml ,name=config.toml
[extra.taxonomy_sorting]
# "ascending_frequency", "descending_frequency" or "name"
# Default value: "descending_frequency"
categories = "name"
tags = "descending_frequency"
authors = "name"
```

### General config

```toml ,name=config.toml
[extra]
# Enable KaTeX math formula support globally.
# Default value: false
math = false

# Enable Mermaid support globally.
# Default value: false
mermaid = false

# Enable comments globally.
# Default value: false
comment = false

# Title separator.
title_separator = " | "

# The top menu.
# See "extra.menus".
header_menu_name = "menu_name"

# If you disable default favicons, you can use
# the inject support to set your own favicons.
# Default value: false
disable_default_favicon = false

# If you want to implement the JS code
# yourself, set to true and use the inject support.
# Default value: false
disable_javascript = false

# Default value: false
use_cdn = false

# Use relative urls.
# It doesn't apply for content yet.
# Default value: false
relative_urls = false

# If you want to view the site without a webserver
# set this and "relative_urls" to true.
# Default value: false
urls_to_index_html = false

# Prioritize summary over description.
# Default value: false
page_summary_on_paginator = false

# Reverse the order of prev and next post links.
# Default value: false
invert_page_navigation = false

# You can reorder the strings, remove them, replace them.
# For example, you can replace "site_title" with "home_button".
# Default value: ["site_title", "theme_button", "search_button", "translations_button"]
# header_buttons = []

# Valid "when" values:
#  "date", "date_updated", "reading_time", "word_count", "authors", "tags", "".
# The "prepend" and "append" are used when the value of "when" is defined for the page.
# e.g. [{when="", prepend="Page Info: "},{when="date",prepend="Published on "},{when="authors",prepend="By "}]
# page_info = [{ when="date" }, { when="date_updated", prepend="(", append=")" }, { when="reading_time" }]
# page_info_on_paginator = [{ when="date" }, { when="reading_time" }]

# Enable table of contents on all pages.
# If not set, toc is enabled only on posts.
# If set to false, toc is disabled on all pages.
# Type: boolean or object
# toc = true
```

### Style config

```toml ,name=config.toml
[extra.style]
# The custom background color.
bg_color = "#f4f4f5"
# The custom background color in dark mode.
bg_dark_color = "#18181b"

# Enable header blur.
header_blur = false

# The custom header color, only available
# when "header_blur" is false.
header_color = "#e4e4e7"
# The custom header color in dark mode, only available
# when "header_blur" is false.
header_dark_color = "#27272a"
```

### Menus

```toml ,name=config.toml
[extra.menus]
menu_name = [
  { url = "$BASE_URL/blog/", name = "Archive" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/categories/", name = "Categories" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/tags/", name = "Tags" },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/about/", name = "About" },
]

# Example multilingual menu.
multilingual_menu_name = [
  { url = "$BASE_URL/about/", names = { en = "About", fr = "About in French" } },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/projects/", names = { en = "Projects", fr = "Projects in French" } },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/blog/", names = { en = "Archive", fr = "Archive in French" } },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/categories/", names = { en = "Categories", fr = "Categories in French" } },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/tags/", names = { en = "Tags", fr = "Tags in French" } },
  { url = "$BASE_URL/authors/", names = { en = "Authors", fr = "Authors in French" } },
]
```

To use a menu, set `extra.header_menu_name`.

`$BASE_URL` in `url` will be automatically replaced with the language specific base url.
You can use `names_i18n` instead of `names`, see the `static/i18n.json` file,
set `names_i18n` to a `common_` key.

You can use [Internal links](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/linking/#internal-links) instead of `$BASE_URL`.

### Profiles

```toml ,name=config.toml
# Replace "your_username" with your username.
[extra.profiles.your_username]

# The URL of avatar.
# e.g. "icons/github.svg"
avatar_url = ""

# A description of what is in the avatar.
avatar_alt = ""

# Invert avatar color in dark mode.
# Default value: false
avatar_invert = false

# Profile name.
# Default value: the username
name = ""

# Profile bio.
# Supports Markdown.
bio = ""

# Social icons.
# "name" should be the file name of "static/icons/*.svg" or
# the icon name of https://simpleicons.org/
# "url" supports "$BASE_URL".
# Other variables: "urls", "title", "titles".
social = [
    { name = "bluesky", url = "https://bsky.app/profile/username" },
    { name = "github", url = "https://github.com/username" },
    { name = "email", url = "mailto:example@example.com" },
    { name = "rss", url = "$BASE_URL/atom.xml" },
]
```

### Profile translations

Skip if your site is not multilingual.

```toml ,name=config.toml
# For French. Replace "your_username" with your username.
[extra.profiles.your_username.languages.fr]

# A description of what is in the avatar.
avatar_alt = ""

# Profile name.
name = ""

# Profile bio.
# Supports Markdown.
bio = ""

# Social icons.
social = []
```

### Open Graph for profiles

See [the Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/).

```toml ,name=config.toml
# Replace "your_username" with your username.
[extra.profiles.your_username.open_graph]

# The URL of social image.
image = ""

# A description of what is in the social image.
# Default value: ""
image_alt = ""

# Your first name. No default value.
first_name = ""
# Your last name. No default value.
last_name = ""
# Your username. No default value.
username = ""
# e.g. "female" or "male". No default value.
gender = ""

# fb_app_id = "Your fb app ID"
# fb_admins = ["YOUR_USER_ID"]

# Set if you have a Fediverse account.
#  handle - Your Fediverse handle.
#  domain - Your Fediverse instance.
#  url - Your Fediverse account URL. Optional.
# Example for @me@mastodon.social:
# { handle = "me", domain = "mastodon.social" }
fediverse_creator = { handle = "", domain = "" }
```

`image` and `image_alt` of the default author's profile will be used
as a fallback open graph image for all pages.

#### Open Graph translations

Skip if your site is not multilingual.

```toml ,name=config.toml
# For French. Replace "your_username" with your username.
[extra.profiles.your_username.open_graph.languages.fr]
# A description of what is in the social image.
image_alt = ""
```

### The page footer

```toml ,name=config.toml
[extra.footer]
# Replace with the correct year.
# Default value: the current year
since = 2025

# Replace with the URL of the license you want.
# No default value. Supports "$BASE_URL".
license_url = "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed"

# Replace "Your Name" with your name and "CC BY-SA 4.0" with the name of the license you want.
copyright = "&copy; $YEAR Your Name &vert; [CC BY-SA 4.0]($LICENSE_URL)"

# Not used yet.
# Supports "$BASE_URL".
# privacy_policy_url = "$BASE_URL/privacy-policy/"

# Not used yet.
# Supports "$BASE_URL".
# terms_of_service_url = "$BASE_URL/terms-of-service/"

# Not used yet.
# Supports "$BASE_URL".
# search_page_url = "$BASE_URL/search/"
```

The `copyright` variable supports Markdown, `$BASE_URL`, `$YEAR` (uses `since`), and `$LICENSE_URL` (uses `license_url`).

## ⓘ Background

While searching for themes, I stumbled upon [Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Unfortunately, the last update was on December, 2021. Soon after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name **Mabuya** comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Simple Blog
- ✅ Pagination
- ✅ Tags
- ✅ Dark Theme and Toggle
- ✅ Back-to-Top Button

## 📈 Improvements

While working on the theme, I have added new functionality and made many quality of life improvements. Here's a short list:

- Refactored stylesheets to make it easier to [grok](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grok).
- Added a dark theme and toggle.
- Added new footer navigation.
- Created a custom GitHub Action to deploy Zola sites faster than any other GitHub Actions without using Docker.
- Refined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.
- Centralized custom variables to make it easier to customize the site's colors.
- Addressed PR [#7](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/pull/7) fixing the pagination problem present in the original Zola theme.
- Addressed Issue [#4](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/4) fixing custom text not being used correctly.
- Addressed (temporarily) Issue [#1](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/1) by removing the erroneous pinned marker.
- Optimized for speed and accessibility. Subtle color changes to make the text more readable, etc.
- Many other small improvements eventually resulting in a perfect [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) score:

</div>

## 🚀 Quick Start

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ v0.18.0. After which you'll need to:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/mabuya.git
```

2. Change directory into new cloned repository:

```shell
cd mabuya
```

3. Serve the site locally:

```shell
zola serve
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

## 🎨 Customization

You can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the [config.toml](config.toml), and [templates](templates) for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of [config.toml](config.toml) to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to [sass/_custom.scss](sass/_custom.scss). This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.

# General

I am not the best webmaster, but should be somewhat responsive.
I intentionally using the bigger fonts to make, feel free to change it in main.scss


# Light mode
Now light mode also supported. 

# Important
Please make sure to set up your base_url with trailing slash:
```toml
base_url = "https://kuznetsov17.github.io/minimal-dark/"
```
# Comments
Theme supports [Giscuss](https://giscuss.app) for comments. The configuration is done via config.toml. Here you can see the example section used for this page deployment:
```toml
[extra.giscus]
data_repo="kuznetsov17/minimal-dark"
data_repo_id="R_kgDOLIfXYA"
data_category="General"
data_category_id="DIC_kwDOLIfXYM4Ccn56"

```

# Page onfigurations
Customize the page blocks by setting configuration in **[extra]** section:
```toml
copyright_string = "Сreated in %YEAR% for fun." # the string displayed in footer. %YEAR% is replaced by current year on build
show_copyright = true / false # enables / disables footer with copyright
show_comments = true / false # enables / disables comments
show_shares = true / false # enables / disables section with social share buttons
show_toc = true / false # enables / disable TOC
show_date = true / false # displays publication date in page
```

# Blog
I am using this theme for my [notes](https://viku.me/notes/), or probably blog. 
The section template supports pagination, tags, sorts the pages by publication date. You may see the working example [here](/notes/)

# config.toml extras
```toml
author = "John Doe" # author. Will be puth in page metadata
description = "Some description, if you somehow didn't set it in page / section settings"
logo_src = "images/logo.svg" # logo src
avatar_src = "images/avatar.png" # avatar src
index_page="index" # name of the index page. Should be one of top_menu to make things work
top_menu = ["index","features","notes"] # Menu items
copyright_string = "Сreated by John Doe in 2024 – %YEAR% for fun." # footer content. %YEAR% will be replaced with current year
nonce = "${SOME_HASH_VALUE}" # used for JavaScript src nonce
```

## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ git submodule add git@github.com:lucasnasm/nasm-theme.git themes/nasm-theme
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "nasm-theme"
```

This theme requires your index section (`content/_index.md`) to be paginated to work:

```toml
paginate_by = 5
```

The posts should therefore be in directly under the `content` folder.

The theme requires tags and categories taxonomies to be enabled in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    # You can enable/disable RSS
    {name = "categories", rss = true},
    {name = "tags", rss = true},
]
```
If you want to paginate taxonomies pages, you will need to overwrite the templates
as it only works for non-paginated taxonomies by default.


## Options
### Disqus
set a field `extra` with key of `disqus_username`:
```toml
disqus_username = 'username'
```
### Top-menu
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `nasm-theme`:  
Font Awesome default icons
```toml
nasm_menu = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL", name = "Home", fawesome = "fas fa-home"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories", fawesome = "fas fa-folder-open"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags", fawesome = "fas fa-tag" },
    {url = "$BASE_URL/about", name = "About", fawesome = "fas fa-user-alt" },

]
```

If you put `$BASE_URL` in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual
site URL.

### Title
The site title is shown on the homepage. As it might be different from the `<title>`
element that the `title` field in the config represents, you can set the `nasm_theme_title`
instead.

## Original
This template is based on the Zola template https://github.com/getzola/after-dark

# no style, please!

A (nearly) no-CSS, fast, minimalist [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) theme.
Ported from from [riggraz](https://riggraz.dev/)'s [no style, please! Jekyll theme](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/), and you can find the demo [here](https://atgumx.gitlab.io/no-style-please/)

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://gitlab.com/4bcx/no-style-please.git
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "no-style-please"
```

## Options

### Default taxonomies

Special templates for `tags`, `categories`, and `contexts` taxonomies are provided. However, generic templates exist for custom taxonomies.

To use taxonomies, in a page metadata add

```toml
[taxonomies]
tags = [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ]
categories = [ 'category A', 'B class' ]
genre = [ 'rock', 'alternative' ]   # custom taxonomy
```

### Pages list in homepage

To enable listing of pages in homepage add the following in `config.toml`

```toml
[extra]
list_pages = true
```

If you do not want the date of the post added next to the title in the list, add the following as well:

```toml
no_list_date = true
```

### Header and footer nav links

Also in the `extra` section in `config.toml`

```toml
[extra]

header_nav = [
    { name = "~home", url = "/" },
    { name = "#tags", url = "/tags" },
    { name = "+categories", url = "/categories" },
    { name = "@contexts", url = "/contexts" },
    { name = "example", url = "http://example.com", new_tab=true },
]
footer_nav = [
    { name = "< previous", url = "#" },
    { name = "webring", url = "#" },
    { name = "next >", url = "#" },
]
```

### Add TOC to pages

In a page frontmatter, set `extra.add_toc` to `true`

```toml
[extra]
add_toc = true
```

### Extra data

- `author` can be set in both main config and in pages metadata
- `image` variable can be used in pages to add an image to HTML `<meta>` tags
- Same for `logo` in main config, except this one is also used as the site icon

### Horizontal rule shortcode `hr()`

Adds the option to insert text in the thematic break

```html
{{/* hr(data_content="footnotes") */}}
```

is rendered

![thematic break screenshot](./hr_footnotes.png)

### Invertable image `iimg()`

Images are not inverted in darkmode by default. To add an invertable image use the following

```html
{{/* iimg(src="logo.png", alt="alt text") */}}
```

In light mode

![image in light mode](./iimg_light.png)

In dark mode

![image in dark mode](./iimg_dark.png)

### Disable Twitter card

Twitter metatags are generated by default, to disable them set `extra.twitter_card` to `false` in in your `config.toml`

```toml
[extra]
twitter_card = true
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add RTL support
- [ ] Write proper test pages

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

    otherworld - a zola theme

you can see the demo [here](https://world.blek.codes)

## how to use

### prerequisities
1. a linux system. you can use windows for that, but this guide centers itself on linux based systems.
2. you need to have these programs installed: `git` and `zola`
3. some creativity, html and scss skills

### steps
#### 1. clone the repo
(aka download the theme)

lets assume that your website's directory name in `daftpunk`. it will appear in commands a few times, and you should replace it with your website's name.

```sh
$ git clone git@git.blek.codes:blek/otherworld.git daftpunk
$ cd daftpunk
```

#### 2. open an another terminal
in the same directory, run

```sh
$ zola serve
```

#### 3. edit files in the `content` directory...

...as per [zola docs](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview)

## how to disable loading
go to `content/index.md`, and in the `+++` blocks, set `extra.noload` to `true`.

like this:
```toml
+++
title = "Welcome"

[extra]
noload = true
+++

## Features

- Blog posts
- Project pages
- Automatic light/dark mode
- Categories and tags
- Optional multilingual support
- Customizable sections and navigation menu links
- Featured images for posts/pages
- Smart image embedding shortcode (`{{/* img() */}}`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `themes` folder:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justint/papaya.git themes/papaya
    ```

2. Set your theme setting in `config.toml` to `papaya`:

    ```toml
    theme = "papaya"
    ```

3. Copy the following sections and keys (and their contents/values) from papaya's [`config.toml`](https://github.com/justint/papaya/blob/main/config.toml) and paste them into your site's `config.toml`:

   - `[languages]`
     - `[languages.en]`
     - `[languages.en.translations]`
   - `[extra.cdn]`
     - `font_awesome`

4. In your `content` directory, add new `blog` and `projects` directories. Copy the `_index.md` file from Papaya's `content/blog` into your `content/blog`, and the `_index.md` and `categories.json` files from Papaya's `content/projects` into your `content/projects`.
 
   Your `content` directory structure should look like this:
   ```
   content
   ├── blog
   │  └── _index.md
   └── projects
      └── _index.md
      └── categories.json
   ```
 
5. _(optional)_ To enable GitHub repository stars/fork counts (disabled by default to avoid hitting API rate limits), set the `$ZOLA_ENV` environment variable to `prod` prior to your `zola serve`/`zola build` execution.
   
   For csh/tsch:
   ```shell
   setenv ZOLA_ENV prod
   ```
   
   For bash/ksh/zsh:
   ```shell
   export ZOLA_ENV=prod
   ```

## Customization

Here are the customizable features of Papaya: 

- Project categories
- Light/dark mode
- Multilingual support
- Sections and navigation menu links
- Post/project date formats
- Post/project featured images
- Open Graph Protocol locale/profile information
- Utterances
- Social/contact links

### Project categories

In your `content/projects/categories.json`, you can specify the categories of projects. The formatting of the file is:

```json
{
   "title": "keyword"
}
```

- `"title"`: the title text displayed for each category grouping on your projects page.
- `"keyword"`: the taxonomy term you'll use in your project pages.

A project can have multiple categories, and will be displayed once in each category configured.

Projects without categories will be displayed in the "Other" category listing of your project page. If you don't want the "Other" category displayed, you can copy the `templates/projects.html` to your own `templates` directory and delete/comment out the "Other" category code.

Example `categories.json`:

```json
{
  "Software": "software",
  "Films": "film"
}
```

Example project page front matter:

```toml
title = "Example software project"
date = 2021-08-11

[taxonomies]
categories = ["software"]
```

The example project page above would be grouped into & displayed within the "Software" category of your projects page.

### Light/dark mode

The Papaya theme can be set to `"light"`, `"dark"`, or `"auto"` mode in the `config.toml`.

In `"auto"`, the light and dark modes are implicitly chosen by the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature. The theme will switch automatically based on the viewer's OS or user agent setting.

### Multilingual support

Currently Zola has basic internationalization (`i18n`) support, you can read more in [zola's Multilingual Sites doc](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/).

To write a multilingual site, follow the steps below (English and Chinese in this example):

1. Add a `default_language` configuration and `[languages.zh]` and `[languages.en]` sections to your `config.toml`:

    ```toml
    default_language = "en"

    [languages]

    [languages.en]

    [languages.zh]
    title = "中文标题"
    description = "中文描述"
    ```

    Under the `[languages.zh]` section you can override default configurations like `title`, `description`, etc.

2. Add translations of all keywords in `[languages.zh.translations]` and `languages.en.translations]` sections (see Papaya's [`config.toml`](config.toml) for a listing of all keywords):

    ```toml
    [languages]

    [languages.en]

    [languages.en.translations]
    projects = "Projects"
    blog = "Blog"
    about = "About"
    recent_projects = "Recent Projects"
    more_projects = "More Projects"
    recent_blog_posts = "Recent Blog Posts"
    more_blog_posts = "More blog posts"
    ...

    [languages.zh]

    [languages.zh.translations]
    projects = "项目"
    blog = "博文"
    about = "关于"
    recent_projects = "近期项目"
    more_projects = "更多项目"
    recent_blog_posts = "近期博文"
    more_blog_posts = "更多博文"
    ...
    ```

3. Add a `_index.zh.md` file into every section. 

   For example: add `content/blog/_index.zh.md` and `content/projects/_index.zh.md`. 

4. Provide a `{page-name}.zh.md` (or `index.zh.md` into the page's directory, if it has one) for every page you'd like to translate.

   For example: add `content/blog/what-is-zola.zh.md` and `content/blog/blog-with-image/index.zh.md`.

6. Add a `content/categories.zh.json` file. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "软件": "software",
        "电影": "film"
    }
    ```

Now you will have a website that supports both English and Chinese! Since `default_language` in `config.toml` is set to "en", by visiting `{base_url}` you will see the English version of this blog. You can visit the Chinese version by visiting `{base_url}/zh`.

A page (post or project) can be available in both languages or only in one language, and it's not necessary that a page is available in the default language.

### Sections and navigation menu links

The navigation menu is constructed from a list of `menu_items` in your `config.toml`. For example:
```toml
[extra]

menu_items = [
   { name = "projects", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/projects", show_recent = true, recent_items = 3, recent_trans_key = "recent_projects", more_trans_key = "more_projects" },
   { name = "blog", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/blog", show_recent = true, recent_items = 3, recent_trans_key = "recent_blog_posts", more_trans_key = "more_blog_posts" },
   { name = "tags", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/tags" },
   { name = "about", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/about" },
]
```

A `menu_item` can be one of two things:

- **a link to a section.** Section links can be optionally configured to display its most recently authored items on your index page. See Configuring section menu items.

- **a link to a URL.** See Configuring URL menu items

#### Configuring section menu items

A section is created whenever a directory (or subdirectory) in the content section contains an `_index.md` file; see the [Zola docs on sections](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/). 

Papaya has two sections by default: `projects` and `blog`. You can add additional sections or change section names.  For example, you can add a section called _Diary_. In order to add this section, you need to:

1. Create a directory called `diary` in `content/`.

2. Create an `_index.md` inside `content/diary/`, for example:

    ```toml
    +++
    title = "Diary"
    render = true
    # diary will use blog.html for its template
    template = "blog.html"
    +++
    ```

Sections can be added to the navigation menu, and optionally configured to display its most recently authored items on your index page. To add your section to the navigation menu:

1. In your `config.toml` under the `[extra]` section, add your section to the `menu_items`:

    ```toml
    [extra]
    menu_items = [
        ...
        { name = "diary", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/diary" }
    ]
    ```
   
2. In your `config.toml` under the `[languages.<code>.translations]` section, add your section name translation keys:

   ```toml
   [languages]
   
   [languages.en]
   
   [languages.en.translations]
   diary = "Diary"
   
   [languages.zh]

   [languages.zh.translations]
   diary = "日记"
   ```

   This will add a simple hyperlink to your new _Diary_ section in the navigation menu.

To also display recently authored items from your _Diary_ section on your index page:

1. Add the following attributes to your menu item:

   - `show_recent`: Adds the section's recent items listing to your index page.
   - `recent_items`: Number of recent items to display.
   - `recent_trans_key`: Translation key for the recent items listing title text.
   - `more_trans_key`: Translation key for the hyperlink text to the section.

   For example:

   ```toml
   [extra]
   menu_items = [
       ...
       { name = "diary", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/diary", show_recent = true, recent_items = 3, recent_trans_key = "recent_diary", more_trans_key = "more_diary" }
   ]
   ```

2. In your `config.toml` under the `[languages.<code>.translations]` section, add your section name, `recent_trans_key`, and `more_trans_key` translation keys:

    ```toml
    [languages]

    [languages.en]

    [languages.en.translations]
    diary = "Diary"
    recent_diary = "Recent Diaries"
    more_diary = "More Diaries"

    [languages.zh]

    [languages.zh.translations]
    diary = "日记"
    recent_diary = "近期日记"
    more_diary = "更多日记"
    ```
   
   This will add both a hyperlink to your new _Diary_ section in the navigation menu, and a listing of the three most recent items from your _Diary_ section on your index page.

#### Configuring URL menu items

If you want to add a simple link to the navigation menu, add an item with a `name` and `url`. For example:

```toml
[extra]
sections = [
    ...
    { name = "tag", url = "$LANG_BASE_URL/tags" }
]
```

A translation key for your link's `name` must be added into your `config.toml`:

```toml
[languages]

[languages.en]

[languages.en.translations]
tag = "Tag"

[languages.zh]

[langauges.zh.translations]
tag = "标签"
```

If you include `$BASE_URL` in the URL of a link it will be replaced with the base URL of your site, and `$LANG_BASE_URL` will be replaced with the language-specific base URL of your site.

### Post/project date formats

You can have different date formats in different languages. You need to set the `date_format` value in every langauge's translation section.

Example:

```toml
[languages]

[languages.en]

[languages.en.translations]
date_format = "%e %B %Y"

[languages.zh]

[languages.zh.translations]
date_format = "%Y 年 %m 月 %d 日"
```

The formatting uses the standard `date` filter in Tera. The date format options you can use are listed in the [chrono crate documentation](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#date).

### Post/project featured images

Posts and projects can have featured images which display at the top of their page before the page contents.

```toml
[extra]
featured_image = "image.jpg"
featured_image_alt = "A lodge overlooks a forested mountain range."
```

![Featured image](pics/featured_image.png)

Featured images can also be extended to the full width of the viewport:

```toml
[extra]
featured_image = "image.jpg"
featured_image_alt = "A lodge overlooks a forested mountain range."
featured_image_extended = true
```

![Featured image, extended](pics/featured_image_extended.png)

### Open Graph Protocol locale/profile information

In your `config.toml` you can add a `[extra.ogp]` section to specify your Open Graph Protocol locale and profile information.

Open Graph Protocol provides you control over how your website's content should be displayed on social media sites. 

For the more information on Open Graph Protocol and valid property values, visit the official [website](https://ogp.me/). 

Example:

```toml
[extra.ogp]
locale = "en_US"
first_name = "Papaya"
last_name = "Tiliqua"
gender = "female"
username = "tiliquasp"
```

### Utterances

[Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is a comments widget built on GitHub issues. When enabled, Papaya can display GitHub issues as comments on your blog posts.

To enable:

1. Follow instructions on the [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) website.

2. Once you're at the "Enable Utterances" step, enter the following keys into your `config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [extra.utterances]
   enabled = true
   repo = "yourname/yourrepository" # put your repository's short path here
   post_map = "pathname"
   label = "utterances"
   theme = "preferred-color-scheme"

### Social/contact links

In your `config.toml` you can add a `[extra.social]` section to specify your social network/contact accounts. Changing these will update what links appear on your website's footer.

Example:

```toml
[extra.social]
email = "papaya@tiliqua.sp"
github = "papaya"
linkedin = "papayatiliqua"
twitter = "papayathehisser"
```

If you want to include other custom social websites, you can add them to `other`:

Example:

```toml
[extra.social]
other = [
    { name = "BTC", font_awesome = "fa-brands fa-btc", url = "https://www.bitcoin.com/" }
]
```

The `font_awesome` attribute specifies the Font Awesome classes; you can find them in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Be aware that different versions of Font Awesome may include different sets of icons; you can change your version of Font Awesome by updating the CDN path in the `[extra.cdn]` section:

```toml
[extra]

[extra.cdn]
font_awesome = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta2/css/all.min.css"
```

## Image embedding shortcode

Included with Papaya is a shortcode for embedding images into your posts:

```
img(path, alt, caption, class, extended_width_pct, quality)
```

You can use `./<image-path>` to specify the relative path of image which is relative to current markdown file.

### Arguments

- `path`: The path to the image. It can be either:
  - a full path (eg: `https://somesite.com/my-image.jpg`), 
  - relative to the `content` directory in the [directory structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/) (eg: `@/projects/project-1/my-image.jpg`), or
  - relative to the current markdown file (eg: `./my-image.jpg`).
- `alt`: _(optional)_ The alternate text for the image.
- `caption`: _(optional)_ A caption for the image. Text/HTML/Tera templates supported.
- `class`: _(optional)_ Any CSS classes to assign to the image. Multiple classes should be separated with a space (`" "`).
- `quality`: _(optional)_ JPEG or WebP quality of the image, in percent.  Only used when encoding JPEGs or WebPs; default value is `90`.
- `extended_width_pct`: _(optional)_ The percentage by which the image's width should be expanded past it's default figure width, up to maximum configured pixel width. 

   Range is `0.0-1.0`, or `-1` for document width. 

   Max pixel width can be defined in your `config.toml`  with the `extra.images.max_width` property (2500px default).

   See Extended width images section for more details and examples.

The benefits of using this shortcode over regular Markdown/HTML image embedding are:

- Images are automatically resized for best performance, using Zola's [image processing functions](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/image-processing/)
- Images & captions are ✨pre-styled✨ for you
- Images can have their width extended past the document's width (see: Extended width images
- Less HTML/CSS boilerplate to write


### Extended width images

Images embedded into pages using the `img` shortcode can be configured to extend past their document width. This is especially nice for displaying wide/landscape images at higher resolutions.

By default, images embedded with the `img` shortcode will be inserted as a `figure` with default margins:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. Default sizing.") */}}
```

![Default sized image](pics/img_default.png)

With the `extended_width_pct` argument, we can specify a percentage of how much the image should expand outside its default figure width, up to your maximum configured image width (`config.extra.images.max_width`, 2500px default).

Here's an example with `extended_width_pct=0.1`:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. extended_width_pct=0.1",
       extended_width_pct=0.1) */}}
```

![Image extended by 0.1](pics/img_0.1.png)

The image is now displayed with a 10% larger width, while maintaining its original aspect ratio.

Here's an even wider example:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. extended_width_pct=0.2",
       extended_width_pct=0.2) */}}
```

![Image extended by 0.2](pics/img_0.2.png)

The images will resize in resolution up to your maximum configured image width, and will display on the webpage up to the maximum width of the viewport.

You can also force the image width to match the document's width by setting `extended_width_pct` to `-1`:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. extended_width_pct=-1",
       extended_width_pct=-1) */}}
```

![Parchment screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/jsonfry/parchment.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "parchment"
```

## Zola Features

No support for taxonomy.

## Customization

### Base Template

- Adding in your own things to `<head>` (e.g. favicons), your own CSS.
- Adding some content to the footer
- Adding something to the end of the body, like analytics. Create a file like the following in `templates/index.html`.

If you don't want to include the default CSS, then remove the line `{{/* super() */}}`

```html
{%/* extends "parchment/templates/index.html" */%}

{%/* block head */%}
    {{/* super() */}}
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest" />

    <style>
        body {
            font-family: "Comic Sans MS", "Comic Sans", cursive;
        }
    <style>
{%/* endblock head */%}

{%/* block footer */%}
    <p>Created by a human</p>
    {%/* if config.generate_feed */%}
    <p>
        <a
        href="/rss.xml"
        title="subscribe - rss feed"
        >rss</a
        >
    </p>
    {%/* endif */%}
{%/* endblock footer */%}

{%/* block body_end */%}
    <script
      src="https://tinylytics.app/embed/your-code.js"
      defer
    ></script>
{%/* endblock body_end */%}
```

### Colors

The color scheme is based on [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and has both a dark and light theme included, that will follow the browser / OS setting. The colors are set with CSS variables, which you can override by setting your own CSS in `head` block.

```css
    :root {
        --background: white;
        --background-highlights: white;
        --primary: black;
        --secondary: blue;
    }

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        :root {
            --background: black;
            --background-highlights: black;
            --primary: white;
            --secondary: cyan;
        }
    }
```

### TOML config options

The following optional things are available to set in the `config.toml` file.

```toml
[extra]
 head_title = "My Custom <head> Title"
 [[extra.footer_menu]]
    [[extra.footer_menu.links]]
      text = "Parchment theme, by Jason Fry"
      href = "https://jasonfry.co.uk"
    [[extra.footer_menu.links]]
      text = "Made With Zola"
      href = "https://getzola.org"
```

### After Post Nav

There is a block to add things after the nav that appears at the bottom of posts.

`templates/page.html`
```html
{%/* extends "parchment/templates/page.html" */%}

{%/* block after_post_nav */%}
    <p>Reply via email - my first name @ my website address</p>
{%/* endblock after_post_nav */%}
```
### Everything looks too small/big

Everything is set with CSS REMs, so just change the HTML element's font size using CSS:

```css
html { font-size: 32px; }
```

# Configuration
# General

I am not the best webmaster, but should be somewhat responsive.
I intentionally using the bigger fonts to make, feel free to change it in main.css

# Light mode
Now light mode also supported. 

# Important
Please make sure to set up your base_url with trailing slash:
```toml
base_url = "https://kuznetsov17.github.io/pico/"
```
# Comments
Theme supports [Giscuss](https://giscuss.app) for comments. The configuration is done via config.toml. Here you can see the example section used for this page deployment:
```toml
[extra.giscus]
data_repo="kuznetsov17/pico"
data_repo_id="R_kgDOLIfXYA"
data_category="General"
data_category_id="DIC_kwDOLIfXYM4Ccn56"
data_mapping="title"
data_strict="0"
data_reactions_enabled="0"
data_emit_metadata="0"
data_input_position="top"
data_theme="//kuznetsov17.github.io/pico/css/gs_dark.css"
data_lang="en"
crossorigin="anonymous"
nonce=""
```

# Page configurations
Customize the page blocks by setting configuration in **[extra]** section:
```toml
show_copyright = true / false # enables / disables footer with copyright
show_comments = true / false # enables / disables comments
show_shares = true / false # enables / disables section with social share buttons
show_toc = true / false # enables / disable TOC
show_date = true / false # displays publication date in page
```

# Blog
I am using this theme for my [notes](https://viku.me/notes/), or probably blog. 
The section template supports pagination, tags, sorts the pages by publication date. You may see the working example [here](@/notes/_index.md)


# Search
The theme supports the search using [elasticrunrjs](http://elasticlunr.com). To enable the search, you will need the following configuration in **config.toml**:

```toml
build_search_index = true

[search]
index_format = "elasticlunr_json"
```

# config.toml extras
```toml
author = "John Doe" # author. Will be puth in page metadata
description = "Some description, if you somehow didn't set it in page / section settings"
logo_src = "images/logo.svg" # logo src
avatar_src = "images/avatar.png" # avatar src
index_page="index" # name of the index page. Should be one of top_menu to make things work
top_menu = ["index","features","notes"] # Menu items
copyright_string = "Сreated by John Doe in 2024 – %YEAR% for fun." # footer content. %YEAR% will be replaced with current year
nonce = "${SOME_HASH_VALUE}" # used for JavaScript src nonce
```

# polymathic

<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/polymathic?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-polymathic" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=422530&theme=light" alt="polymathic - Zola&#0032;portfolio&#0032;theme&#0032;for&#0032;those&#0032;with&#0032;many&#0032;talents | Product Hunt" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" width="250" height="54" /></a>

polymathic is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) portfolio (and not only) theme. 

I made it for my own portfolio. The theme is called `polymathic`, inspired by individuals with a wide range of talents. The theme focuses on rich and consistent navigation experience, exposing the variety of topics to chose from, yet allowing the user to focus on a single thread of your story once they've made a choice. 

Docs and theme demo are available here [main--polymathic-demo.netlify.app](https://main--polymathic-demo.netlify.app/) 

__Be sure to chek the [demo repo](https://github.com/anvlkv/polymathic-demo/)__ and follow zola docs on [installing and using a theme](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#installing-a-theme)

This theme uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) scss framework, making the theme styles highly customizable and enabling mobile first theme design.

This theme uses [Animate.css](https://animate.style) for animations.

This theme adds minimal [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tags to every page `head`.

You can quickly deploy the theme to [netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/), theme comes with a config file.

## Features

See all features [demonstrated in the docs](https://main--polymathic-demo.netlify.app/features). 

### Media support

The theme is friendly to wide range of screen sizes from `mobile` to `fullhd`. Theme comes with minimal styles for `print` media.

#### Dark mode

Theme includes preference based dark mode as separate stylesheet. No switch.

#### Accessibility

This theme automatically finds accessible colors when using customizations, with minimal config.

This theme supports no script environments.

This theme respects user preference for reduced motion.

### Navigation

This theme builds navigation for your site. The outcome is highly customizable via your `config.toml` and front-matter of your sections.

### Templates

The theme comes with templates for `index.html`, `page.html`, `section.html`, `taxonomy_list.html`, `taxonomy_single.html`, `404.html`. You can use them in your Zola project as is or by extending them, templates are divided in `block`s and `partials/*.html` for convenience of extending the theme.

### Brand and style

The theme is highly customizable via `config.toml` and sass variables. Your customization can start from just the primary color or extend all the way to bulma variables.

### Shortcodes

The theme comes with several shortcodes for building forms, galleries, navigation cards and banners.

## Install

Once you already have zola installed and ran `zola init`, then run from your project directory

    $ git init
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/anvlkv/polymathic themes/polymathic

You will also need [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed, then run

    $ npm --prefix themes/polymathic install

For those using netlify deployments config is available here

    $ cp themes/polymathic/netlify.toml netlify.toml

In your `config.toml` Set zola theme to polymathic

    theme = "polymathic"

# Project Portfolio

> You can find this theme on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio) and [Github](https://github.com/awinterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio).

A [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) theme built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) for presenting the project portfolio of a freelancer, for example. The theme is based on the [Blow](https://www.getzola.org/themes/blow/) theme that was created by Thomas Chartron and on my generic [Daisy](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy) theme. It extends the [Daisy](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy) with specific pages, taxonomies and shortcodes for managing a project portfolio and supports all color schemes of the [Daisy](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-daisy) as well.

![Screenshot of a project page example](screenshot.png)

Check out the [live demo of the example project](https://awinterstein.github.io/zola-theme-project-portfolio-example/)  or a [real-world implementation](https://www.winterstein.biz/) of this theme.

## Features

* Responsive design (looks good on desktop and mobile)
* Automatically selected dark / light modes
* 37 color schemes included
* Customizable navbar and footer (with social links)
* Project types and skills taxonomies
* Search functionality
* Multi-language support
* Pagination
* Customizable favicon
* Error 404 page

## Quick Start

For starting to create a new Zola website using this theme, the easiest approach is to just checkout / fork the [example repository](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio-example) and adapt it to your needs. That repository already contains a minimal structure and configuration for the Zola-based website and can directly be built and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and Github pages.

## Configuration

The minimal `config.toml` file for using the theme looks like this:

```toml
base_url = "https://www.example.com"

theme = "project-portfolio"

taxonomies = [
    {name = "projects", paginate_by = 5, feed = true},
    {name = "skills", paginate_by = 5, feed = true},
]
```

### Color Schemes

Set a light and dark color scheme:

```toml
daisyui_theme_light = "light"
daisyui_theme_dark = "dark"
```

See the `themes` list in the [`theme.toml`](theme.toml) for all possible identifiers. You can also set only a light or a dark color scheme, if you do not want the automatic dark mode switching based on the browser settings of your visitors.

If you want to allow your visitors to change the used color scheme, just set the following variable in the `[extra]` section of your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
enable_theme_switching = true
```

There will be a dropdown in the navbar then, for the visitors to select form the color schemes.

### Languages

To enable support for multiple languages, simply set the default language and add language settings for all your additional languages:

```toml
default_language = "en"

[languages.de]
# title and description in the additional language
title = "Projekt-Portfolio"
description = "Beispiel- und Demoseite des Projekt-Portfolio-Themas für Zola."

# don't forget to enable features like search or feed
# generation for the additional language as well
build_search_index = true
generate_feeds = true

# also any taxonomies of your default language need to
# be defined for the additional language as well
taxonomies = [
    {name = "projects", paginate_by = 5, feed = true},
    {name = "skills", paginate_by = 5, feed = true},
]
```

Taxonomies should have exactly the same (not translated) name in all languages, for the language switching to work best.

You need to create an i18n file containing the translations for all theme variables for all the languages of your website, if they are not included in the theme. Right now, [English](i18n/en.toml), [German](i18n/de.toml) and [Hungarian](i18n/hu.toml) are included. You can create a the directory `i18n` in your website root directory and the language files in there will be picked up by the theme. It would be great, however, if you create a pull-request on the theme repository to add your translations to the theme.

### Search

Integrating a search into your website is as easy as adding the following to your configuration:

```toml
# enable it globally for the default language
build_search_index = true

[search]
# only this format is supported by the theme
index_format = "elasticlunr_json"

# you need to enable search at all your language sections as well
[languages.de]
build_search_index = true
```

As soon as `build_search_index` is enabled, the search indices are created for all languages that have this variable enabled in their section in the `config.toml` and the search bar is shown in the navbar of the website.

Just be aware, that you need to add an [Elasticlunr.js](http://elasticlunr.com/)-compatible [Lunr Languages](https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages) file to your `static` directory, if you are using other languages than English and German. See the corresponding repository for the [`min` files](https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages/tree/master/min). Feel free to add support for your languages to the theme as well, via a pull-request.

### Navbar

Arbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the `[extra.navbar]` section:

```toml
[extra.navbar]
links = [
    { url = "projects", i18n_key = "projects" },
    { url = "skills", i18n_key = "skills" },
    { url = "blog", i18n_key = "blog" },
]
```

The value of the `i18n_key` must be in the `i18n` files for your languages (see [en.toml](i18n/en.toml), for example).

### Footer

All three parts of the footer can be adapted: the links, the social icons, and the copyright notice.

#### Links

Arbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the `[extra.footer]` section:

```toml
[extra.footer]
links = [
    { url = "about", i18n_key = "about" },
    { url = "sitemap.xml", i18n_key = "sitemap", no_translation = true },
]
```

The value of the `i18n_key` must be in the `i18n` files for your languages (see [en.toml](i18n/en.toml), for example). If the parameter `no_translation` is set to true, than the URL is not adapted to contain the current language code. This is needed for external links or something like the `sitemap.xml` in the example, that is not translated within your website.

#### Social Icons

The social icons in the footer can be adapted by setting any of the following variables:

```toml
[extra.social]
codeberg = ""
github = ""
gitlab = ""
stackoverflow = ""
mastodon = ""
linkedin = ""
instagram = ""
youtube = ""
signal = ""
telegram = ""
email = ""
phone = ""
```

For every non-empty variable, the corresponding icon is shown in the footer.

#### Copyright Notice

The copyright notice in the footer can be set by adding the following variable in the configuration:

```toml
[extra.footer]
notice = "This is my <b>copyright</b> notice."
```

HTML can be used there.

### Syntax Highlighting

The theme makes use of Zola code highlighting feature and supports setting a different color scheme depending on whether a light or dark theme is active. Just enable syntax highlighting the following way:

```toml
highlight_code = true
highlight_theme = "css"
```

### Index Page

A title and text can be added to the index page by creating a file `_index.md` in the `content` directory. Additionally, a slogan and an image an be configured in the `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra.index]
slogan = "Slogan text that is shown under the title"
image = "portrait.png"
image_alt = "Placeholder text describing the index's image."
```

You can also created a completely different index page, by overwriting the `index.html` template in the template directory of your site. Just inherit from the `page.html` template of the theme.

## Details on Using the Theme

The installation of the theme works the same as for other Zola themes. As it is described in the [official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/). Hence, it fist needs to be added as a git submodule:

```bash
cd my-zola-website
git submodule add -b main \
    https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio.git \
    themes/project-portfolio
```

Please make sure to add it at the path `themes/project-portfolio` in your Zola directory. The translations and the icons won't work if added to a different directory.

In the `config.toml` file it needs to be selected then:

```toml
theme = "project-portfolio"
```

Create the files `projects.md` and `skills.md` in your `content` directory that are used to show the "Projects" and "Skills" [taxonomies](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/taxonomies/). They both need a title and can optionally get a descriptive text that will be shown above the terms of the taxonomy. See the following `projects.md` file as an example:

```markdown
+++
title = "Projects"
+++

The title and the text of this page can be adapted by changing the
`projects.md` file in the `content` directory.

Check out the amazing projects, by browsing through the industrial
sectors. The project do not need to be categorized by industries, but
could be distinguished by other topics instead. For example by frontend
and backend projects or by main responsibilities, like developer or
lead. Whatever makes most sense for your project portfolio.
```

It would be shown with the configured title and content like this above the terms:

![Screenshot of the projects taxonomy page](https://codeberg.org/winterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio/raw/branch/main/screenshot-projects-taxonomy.png)

The `skills.md` file can be created the same way. The corresponding page will just show the terms of the skills taxonomy instead of the terms of the projects taxonomy then.

Finally, create the first project page in the `content` directory:

```markdown
+++
```

```toml
title = "Project Title"
description = "Here is a short description of the project."
date = 2022-05-31 # The date when the project finished

[extra]
date_start = 2021-01-01 # Optional date when the project was started
image = "water.jpg" # Optional filename to an image in the `static/images` directory
top_project = true # Optional parameter to show the project on the projects overview page as well

[taxonomies]
projects=["Consumer"] # The category of the project (could be industry, type etc.)
skills=["Thinking", "Hype Technology"] # The skills & technologies used for the project
```

```markdown
+++

The content of the project description page follows here.
```

The generated project site would then look like this:

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/micahkepe/radion
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "radion"
```

This theme requires your index section (`content/_index.md`) to be paginated to
work:

```toml
paginate_by = 5
```

The posts should therefore be in directly under the `content` folder.

The theme requires tags and categories taxonomies to be enabled in your
`config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    # You can enable/disable RSS
    {name = "categories", feed = true},
    {name = "tags", feed = true},
]
```

If you want to paginate taxonomies pages, you will need to overwrite the
templates as it only works for non-paginated taxonomies by default.

---

## Options

### Top-menu

Set a field in `extra` with a key of `radion_menu`:

```toml
radion_menu = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL", name = "Home"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags"},
    {url = "https://google.com", name = "Google"},
]
```

If you put `$BASE_URL` in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual
site URL.

### Title

The site title is shown on the homepage. As it might be different from the
`<title>` element that the `title` field in the config represents, you can set
the `radion_title` instead.

### Author

You can set this on a per page basis or in the config file.

`config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
author = "John Smith"
```

In a page (wrap this in +++):

```toml
title = "..."
date = 1970-01-01

[extra]
author = "John Smith"
```

### Favicon

To change the default favicon:

1. Create your own favicon folder with the following site:
   [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

   - Set the 'Favicon path' option to `/icons/favicon/`

2. Unzip the created folder
3. Create a `static/icons/` directory if it does not already exist
4. Place the unzipped `favicon/` directory in `static/icons/`.

By default, favicons are enabled, however, if for some reason you would like to
disable favicons, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
favicon = false
```

### GitHub

To enable a GitHub reference link in the header, set the following in your
`config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
github = "https://github.com/your-github-link"
```

### Code Snippets

#### Syntax Highlighting:

```toml
[markdown]
# Whether to do syntax highlighting
# Theme can be customized by setting the `highlight_theme` variable to a theme
# supported by Zola
highlight_code = true

# For a complete list of themes, see:
# https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/#syntax-highlighting
highlight_theme = "one-dark"
```

#### Enhanced Codeblocks (Clipboard Support and Language Tags)

```toml
[extra]
codeblock = true
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ligatures are disabled by default as defined in the
> [\_theme.scss](./sass/_theme.scss) file.

### LaTex Support

To enable LaTeX support with MathJax, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
latex = true
```

### Searchbar

To enable a searchbar at the top of the page navigation, set the following in
your `config.toml`:

```toml
build_search_index = true

[search]
index_format = "elasticlunr_json"

[extra]
enable_search = true
```

### Light and Dark Modes

To set the color theme of the site, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
theme = "toggle" # options: {light, dark, auto, toggle}
```

There are four options for the `theme` field:

- `light`: Always light mode
- `dark`: Always dark mode
- `auto`: Automatically switch between light and dark mode based on the user's
  system preferences
- `toggle`: Allow the user to toggle between light and dark mode

### Table of Contents

To enable a table of contents on a page, add the following to the front matter
of the page:

```toml
[extra]
toc = true
```

### Comments

> [!NOTE]
> Giscus comments assumes that you are hosting the blog site via GitHub Pages
> and thus have access to GitHub Discussions.

First, follow the instructions at [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/).
This includes installing the Giscus app and enabling discussions on the
GitHup repository that you host the website code. Additionally, fill in the
repository path in the prompt. Then, from the generated script, fill in the
corresponding values in the `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
comments = true  # {true, false}; sets global enabling of comments by default
giscus_repo = "FILL ME IN"
giscus_repo_id = "FILL ME IN"
giscus_data_category_id = "FILL ME IN"
```

Comments can be enabled or disabled on a per page basis by editing the page's
front matter. For example, to disable comments on a specific post:

```toml
[extra]
comments = false
```

The `config.toml` value for `comments` takes precedence and priority. For
example, if you globally disable comments in your `config.toml` by setting
`comments = false`, then trying to enabling comments through a page's front
matter will have no effect.

# re137

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

[Demo](https://re137.vercel.app)

## Installation

Clone this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/tinikov/re137
```

or add it by submodule:

```bash
cd themes
git submodule add git@github.com:tinikov/re137
```

Then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "re137"
```

## Structure and must configs

The posts should be directly under the `content` folder, and the single pages (e.g. `about.md`) should be under the `content/pages` folder.

Your index section in content (`content/_index.md`) should enable the posts sorted by date:

```toml
sort_by = "date"
```

And the index section in pages (`content/pages/_index.md`) should disable the `render` option:

```toml
render = false
```

In both index sections, it's recommended to enable the option for anchors:

```toml
insert_anchor_links = "right"
```

## Options

### Enable categories

To enable category page, `taxonomies` should be set in `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [{ name = "categories" }]
```

### Top-menu

Set a field in `[extra]` of `config.toml` with a key of `re137_menu_links`:

```toml
re137_menu_links = [
    { url = "$BASE_URL", name = "主页" },
    { url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "分类" },
    { url = "$BASE_URL/about", name = "关于" },
    { url = "$BASE_URL/rss.xml", name = "RSS" },
]
```

### Page options

In frontmatter of posts and single pages, supported options are listed below:

```toml
title = " "
path = "about" # This is only for single page
authors = ["TC", "BB"] # If there are several authors
date = 2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00
updated = 2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00
description = " "
draft = true
[taxonomies]
categories = [" "]
[extra]
author_gen = false # Do not generate author
toc_gen = true # Generate table of contents
```

### Misc

You can add more customed options in `[extra]` of `config.toml`

```toml
# Image shown when you share this website to others
ogimage = " "

# SEO settings
seo = true
google_search_console = " "

# Show jump buttons for Indiewebring
indiewebring = true

# For authentication in mastodon
mastodon = "https://o3o.ca/@tinikov"

# Only user name is needed
github = "tinikov"

# Show establish date in the footer
establishdate = "2024"

# CC BY-NC 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
license = true

# Show "🫧 Zola theme re137" in the footer
show_zola_theme = true

# Zola Resume

[Chinese Version](README.CN.md)

Redesigned form [hugo resume](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume).

## Features
+ This is basically a single-page website with auto-scrolling based on left-hand nav.
+ Dedicated project/publications pages allow more detail.
+ Includes a client-side search at '/search'. 
+ Includes an `/admin` endpoint that can allow authorized users to use a WYSIWYG editor and commit files back to markdown, but with a Wordpress/CMS like experience.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alongwy/zola-resume.git
cd zola-resume
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```

## Installation
Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to install the theme in an existing site step by step.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install zola-resume
Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone git@github.com:alongwy/zola-resume.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd mysite
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add git@github.com:alongwy/zola-resume.git themes/zola-resume
```

### Step 3: Configuration
Enable the theme in your config.toml in the site derectory:

```toml
theme = "zola-resume"
```

Or copy the config.toml.example from the theme directory to your project's root directory:

```bash
cp themes/zola-resume/config.toml.example config.toml
```

#### For CMS

```bash
cp themes/zola-resume/static/admin/config.yml static/admin/config.yml
```

and change those

```yaml
# static/admin/config.yml

backend:
  name: github
  repo: USERNAME/REPO
  branch: BRANCH
  cms_label_prefix: netlify-cms/
  site_domain: DOMAIN.netlify.com
```

### Step 4: Add new content
You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```
cp -r themes/zola-resume/data .
cp -r themes/zola-resume/content .
```

You can modify or add new posts in the content/blog, content/projects or other content directories as needed.

### Step 5: Run the project
Just run zola serve in the root path of the project:

```
zola serve
```

This will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at http://127.0.0.1:1111. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## Examples

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alongwy/zola-resume/master/screenshot.png)

See [along's site](https://resume.alongwy.top) for a live example.

## Setup & Use

This theme uses a combination of custom sections and some data files to drive content.

### Summary
Edit the main `contents/_index.md with a brief bio/summary`

### Data files
Data files are used for simple content presented on the homepage.

- [data/certifications.json](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/blob/main/data/certifications.json)
- [data/social.json](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/blob/main/data/social.json)
- [data/skills.json](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/blob/main/data/skills.json)
- [data/experience.json](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/blob/main/data/experience.json)
- [data/education.json](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/blob/main/data/education.json)

### Projects/Opensource

The difference indicates your role as originator or colaborator.

### Publications
Similar to projects, create them under `publications`. Include any papers, speaking engagements, articles, etc.

### Blog / Posts
Similar to posts, create them under `blog`. Include any thoughts, musiings, etc.
**This template does not support a `posts` folder**

### Template params

Almost All personal information outside the above details is captured by extra in [`config.toml`](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/blob/main/config.toml), or can be edited in the "Settings" collection if using CMS.

## CMS Editor with Netlify CMS
**Does not require deployment to Netlify!**

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is an open source project that enables CMS like experience for static site generation tools like Hugo. This theme includes a fully working integration and guide in [static/admin](https://github.com/AlongWY/zola-resume/tree/main/static/admin)

## Credits

This project ports the Hugo Resume theme by Feng Yunlong to support zola.

# Sam

> A Simple and Minimalist theme with a focus on typography and content.
>
> [Zola][zola] port of [hugo-theme-sam][hugo-sam].

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Original

This is a port of the original [hugo-theme-sam][hugo-sam] theme for Hugo ([License][upstream-license]).

See [`upstream`][upstream] for source code take from there.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this theme is to either clone it ...

```
git clone https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-sam.git themes/sam
```

... or to use it as a submodule.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-sam.git themes/sam
```

Either way, you will have to enable the theme in your `config.toml`.

```toml
theme = "sam"
```

## Taxonomies

Sam supports the `tags` and `authors` taxonomies.

To use them, declare them in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    { name = "tags", rss = true },
    { name = "authors", rss = true }
]
```

Set them in your page's frontmatter:

```toml
[taxonomies]
tags = ["some", "tag"]
authors = ["Alice", "Sam"]
```

See [Zola's documentation][taxonomies-docs] for more details.

## Options

See [`config.toml`][config] for an example configuration.

### Menu

The menu on the index page is created as follows: If the `sam_menu` variable is set, it gets used.

```toml
[extra]
sam_menu = [
    { text = "posts", link = "/posts" },
    { text = "about", link = "/about" },
    { text = "github", link = "https://github.com" }
]
```

If it is not set, all sections under `content` will get linked.

#### Bottom menu

This variable decides wether the menu - as mentioned above - will also be displayed at the bottom of pages.

Default: `false`

```toml
[extra]
sam_bottom_menu = true
```

### `home`

Sets the name for all links referring to the home page in the menus and the 404 page.

Default: `home`

```toml
[extra]
home = "home"
```

### Date format

Specifies how to display dates. The format is described [here][date-format-docs].

Default: `%a %b %e, %Y`

```toml
[extra]
date_format = "%a %b %e, %Y"
```

### Word count and reading time

You can enable or disable word count and reading time for posts across the whole site:

Default: `true` (both)

```toml
[extra]
show_word_count = true
show_reading_time = true
```

If enabled, you can opt-out per page via front-matter:

Default: `false` (both)

```
+++
[extra]
hide_word_count = true
hide_reading_time = true
+++
```

### Disable page header

If you want to disable the complete header of a page (for example a page which is explicitly not a post), you can do so via front-matter:

Default: `false`

```
+++
[extra]
no_header = true
+++
```

### Footer

To place some text at the end of pages, set the following:

```toml
[extra.sam_footer]
text = "Some footer text."
```

# Seagull

A Zola theme.

![gull](./static/img/gull_rect.svg)

## Installation

Add the theme as a git submodule

```bash
git submodule add --name seagull https://git.42l.fr/HugoTrentesaux/seagull.git themes/seagull
```

Enable the theme in your `config.toml`

```
theme = "seagull"
```

Add a `_variables.sass` file in a `sass` folder

```sh
mkdir sass
touch sass/_variables.sass
```

Add a `_index.md` file in your `content` folder.

## Features

Features can be seen on the demo website: https://seagull.coinduf.eu/.

You can customize the theme with the `/sass/_variables.sass` file.

## Support

I'll provide support on demand on [Zola forum](https://zola.discourse.group/) if you tag [@HugoTrentesaux](https://zola.discourse.group/u/hugotrentesaux/summary)

## Build website

Because of the hack used to allow theme customization, before building seagull website itself, you need to create an empty file

```sh
mkdir ../../sass
touch ../../sass/_variables.sass
```

# Seje2

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

[Demo](https://eatradish.github.io/Seje2)
[简体中文](https://github.com/eatradish/Seje2/blob/main/README_zh_cn.md)

## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/eatradish/Seje2
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "Seje2"
```

This theme requires your index section (`content/_index.md`) to be paginated to work:

```toml
paginate_by = 5
```

The posts should therefore be in directly under the `content` folder.

and requires your index section (`about/_index.md`) to be paginated to work:

```toml
title = "..."

[extra]
year = 2019
month = 11
day = 3
```

## Options

### Top-menu
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `seje2_menu_links`:

```toml
seje2_menu_links = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL", name = "Home"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags"},
    {url = "https://google.com", name = "Google"},
]
```

If you put `$BASE_URL` in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual
site URL.

### MathJax Latex Support
Set a field in `extra` with a bool key of `seje_mathjax`:

```toml
seje_mathjax = true
```

### License

Set a field in `extra` with a key of `license`:

```toml
license = "@ 宇宙眼镜人"
```

## Features

- [X] Themes (light, dark). Default theme is dark with a switcher in the navbar
- [X] Projects page
- [x] Social Links
- [x] Tags

## Installation

0. Initialize Git Repo if not initialized

1. Download the theme
```
git submodule add https://github.com/syedzayyan/shadharon themes/shadharon
```

2. Add `theme = "shadharon"` to your `config.toml`

3. Copy the example content

```
cp -R themes/shadharon/content/. content
```

## Customization

1. For customization refer to config.toml files, which has comments.

2. For customizing the banner on the homepage the content/posts/_index.md needs modification. The desc variable under `extra`, specifically. You could delete this as well to remove banner. For an about page or any aditional page an .md file in the "content" directory will do.

You can add stylesheets to override the theme:

```toml
[extra]
stylesheets = [
    "override.css",
]
```

These filenames are relative to the root of the site. In this example, the two CSS files would be in the `static` folder.

# simple-dev-blog-zola-starter

A simple dev-blog theme for Zola. It uses no JavaScript, prerenders links between navigation, blog posts and tags and adds common tags for SEO.

You can view it live [here](https://simple-dev-blog-zola-starter.netlify.app/).

## How to get started

To create a new Zola site, first download the CLI and install it on your system. This theme requires Zola version 0.14 or greater.


You can find installation instructions [on the Zola website](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).

1. After you've installed the Zola CLI, run the following command to create a new site:

   ```sh
   zola init my_amazing_site
   cd my_amazing_site
   ```

2. After you've created the site, install the "Simple Dev Blog" theme like so:

   ```sh
   git clone --depth=1 \
     https://github.com/bennetthardwick/simple-dev-blog-zola-starter \
     themes/simple-dev-blog
   ```

3. Now in your `config.toml` file, choose the theme by setting `theme = "simple-dev-blog"`.

4. This theme uses the `tags` taxonomy, in your `config.toml` file set `taxonomies = [ { name = "tags" } ]`

5. Copy across the default content from the theme by running `cp themes/simple-dev-blog/content/* ./content -r`

6. That's it! Now build your site by running the following command, and navigate to `127.0.0.1:111`:

   ```sh
   zola serve
   ```

You should now have a speedy simple dev blog up and running, have fun!

# Slim

Slim is a minimal, clean and beautiful theme for [Zola](http://getzola.org/).

This theme was ported to Zola, the original is available at [zhe/hugo-theme-slim](https://github.com/zhe/hugo-theme-slim). It is excellent, thank you [zhe](https://github.com/zhe)!

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The fastest way to create a new site is to use the [tabi-start template](https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start). This gives you a complete blog setup with all the essential configuration ready to go.

### Manual installation

To add tabi to you existing Zola site:

0. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory (if you haven't already):

```
git init
```

1. Add the theme as a git submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git themes/tabi
```

Or clone the theme into your themes directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git themes/tabi
```

### Required configuration

2. Enable the theme in your `config.toml`:

```
theme = "tabi"
```

3. Set a `title` in your `config.toml`:

```
title = "Your Site Title"
```

4. Configure code block highlighting in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[markdown]
highlight_code = true
highlight_theme = "css"
```

5. Create a `content/_index.md` file. This file controls how your home page looks and behaves. Choose one of the following options:

   **Option A: Serve posts from `/`**:

   ```
   +++
   title = "Home"
   paginate_by = 5  # Show 5 posts per page.
   +++
   ```

   - This will display posts in `content/` with pagination.

   **Option B: Serve posts from a different path (e.g., `blog/`)**:

   ```
   +++
   title = "Home"
   # Note we're not setting `paginate_by` here.

   [extra]
   section_path = "blog/_index.md"  # Where to find your posts.
   max_posts = 5  # Show 5 posts on the home page.
   +++
   ```

    - This will display the latest 5 posts from the `blog/` section.
    - Do not set `paginate_by` if you choose this option.
    - Use the full path to the section's `_index.md` file. Using `section_path = "blog/"` will not work.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not set both `paginate_by` and `section_path` in `content/_index.md`.
>
> These settings are mutually exclusive and using both may result in no posts being displayed.

6. If you want an introduction section (see screenshot above), add these lines to `content/_index.md`:

```
[extra]
header = {title = "Hello! I'm tabi~", img = "img/main.webp", img_alt = "Your Name" }
```

The content outside the front matter will be rendered between the header title and the posts listing. In the screenshot above, it's the text that reads "tabi is a fast, lightweight, and modern Zola theme…".

7. If you want a multilingual site, you will need to set up each language. In `config.toml`, set the title and taxonomies for each language, like:

```toml
[languages.es]
title = "~/tabi"
taxonomies = [{name = "tags", feed = true}]
```

You will need an `_index.{language_code}.md` per language for each section (e.g. /blog or /projects) that you want to enable in that language.

The same is true for individual posts, which should have the exact same name as the default language, with an extra `.{code}` before the extension (e.g. the Spanish version of `security.md` would be `security.es.md`).

This configuration allows the language switcher to take the user to the translation of the current URL. If a translation doesn't exist, the 404 page will be displayed, with an explanation in each language set in the config.

To learn more about multilingual support, see the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/faq-languages/).

### Updating tabi

If you added the theme as a git submodule, run:

```bash
git submodule update --remote themes/tabi
```

If you cloned it:

```bash
cd themes/tabi
git pull
```

# Tale-Zola Theme


Tala-Zola is a minimal [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme helping you to
build a light and seo-ready blog, and you can customise any information of the
blog without having to modify the codes of the template. Tala-Zola is a port of
the Jekyll theme [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale).


## Demo

[Live Preview](https://tale-zola.netlify.app/).

## Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ 0.13.0.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aaranxu/tale-zola.git
cd tale-zola
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

## Installation

Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to
install the theme in an existing site step by step.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init blog
```

### Step 2: Install Tale-Zola

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd blog/themes
git clone git@github.com:aaranxu/tale-zola.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd blog
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add git@github.com:aaranxu/tale-zola.git themes/tale-zola
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Enable the theme in your `config.toml` in the site derectory:

```toml
theme = "tale-zola"
```

Or copy the `config.toml.example` from the theme directory to your project's
root directory:

```bash
cp themes/tale-zola/config.toml.example config.toml
```

### Step 4: Add new content

Add an `_index.md` file to your `content` directory with some lines as bellows.

```text
+++
sort_by = "date"
paginate_by = 5
+++
```

Add a blog article file with a filename `first-post.md` (or other filenames) and
input some content in it.

```text
+++
title = "First Post"
date = 2021-05-01T18:18:18+00:00

[taxonomies]
tags = ["Post"]

[extra]
author = "Your Name"
+++

This is my first post.
```


Or you can just copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```bash
cp -r themes/tale-zola/content .
```

### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

Tale-Zola will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## Customisation

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `theme.toml` and templates files in this repo for an idea.

In most cases you only need to modify the content in the `config.toml` file to
custom your blog, including different expressions in your speaking language.

### Necessary Configurations

Add some information for your blog.

```toml
title = "You Blog Title"
description = "The description of your blog."
```

Set the tags for the site.

```toml
taxonomies = [
  {name = "tags"},
]
```

Add menus and footer information for your blog.

```
# Menu items
[[extra.menu]]
name = "Posts"
url = "/"

[[extra.menu]]
name = "Tags"
url = "tags"

[[extra.menu]]
name = "About"
url = "about"

[extra.footer]
start_year = "2020"  # start year of the site
end_year = "2021"    # end year of the site
info = "The information on the footer."
```

#### Option Configurations

Add your name as the author name for the blog globally.

```toml
[extra]
author = "Your Name"
```

Use Google Analytics. Add your own Google Analytics ID.

```toml
[extra]
google_analytics = "UA—XXXXXXXX-X"
```

Whether to use Disqus globally and set to your disqus id name.
And you can enable the disqus on per post page with `extra.disqus` option

```toml
[extra]
disqus = false
disqus_id = ""
```

Code syntax highlighting. See also [syntax highlighting](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/#syntax-highlighting).

```toml
[markdown]
highlight_code = true
highlight_theme = "base16-ocean-light"
```

Use KaTeX to support the math notation

```toml
[extra]
katex = true
```

> Note: You can also add the `katex` option on per mardown file of the page or section.

Set date format in the site

```toml
[extra]
timeformat = "%B %e, %Y" # e.g. June 14, 2021, and this is the default format
```

SEO settings, like Open Graph + Twitter Cards

```toml
[extra.seo]
# this image will be used as fallback if a page has no image of its own
image = "tale.png"
image_height = 50
image_width = 50
og_locale = "en_US"

  [extra.seo.twitter]
  site = "twitter_accout"
  creator = "twitter_accout"

  [extra.seo.facebook]
  admins = "facebook_accout"
  publisher = "facebook_accout"
```

Change the words in your speaking language.

```toml
[extra.expressions]
home = "Home"              # The homepage's name
pinned = "Pinned"          # On the header of the post list
written_by = "Written by"  # Like: Written by Aaran Xu
on = "on"                  # Like: on May 3, 2021
top = "Top"                # Go to the top of the page in the post
tags = "Tags"              # In the page of Tags

# disqus comments block
disqus_discussion = "Discussion and feedback"

# The contents of the 404 page
p404 = "404: Page not found"
p404_info = "Oops! We can't seem to find the page you are looking for."
p404_back_home_start = "Let's"
p404_back_home_with_link = "head back home"
p404_back_home_end = "."
```

### Custom CSS styles

Just add your own styles to `sass/_custom.scss` file.

![A screenshot (light theme) of the example page of the demo website](https://github.com/TeaDrinkingProgrammer/tranquil/blob/main/screenshot-light.png?raw=true)
<br />
A blog theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org). Simple, elegant and uses Tailwind. Based on [Isunjns Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene).

## Demo

-  <https://teadrinkingprogrammer.github.io/tranquil-demo/>
-  My own blog: <https://teadrinkingprogrammer.github.io>

## Features

- A simple and elegant design.
- Projects page: display a list of the projects you have worked on with links.
- Theme toggle: switch between light and dark theme regardless of your browser preference.
- Image zooming using [Lightense](https://github.com/sparanoid/lightense-images): zoom in on images by clicking on them.
- Out-of-date alert: show alerts when your post is outdated.
- Callouts (note, warning, alert, etc.) that can be used right in Markdown.
- Comments using [Giscus](https://giscus.app).
- Mathematical notations using [KaTeX](https://katex.org).
- Diagrams and visualizations using [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid).

## Shoutouts

This theme wouldn't have existed without [Isunjns Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene). It's a great theme, so go check that one out as well.

When I doubted about layout, I always went to look at [FasterThanLimes blog](https://fasterthanli.me) to see how he did it.

Of course, this website wouldn't render without [Zola](https://getzola.org) and it wouldn't show anything without [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Tranquil vs Serene

Tranquil is a fork of Serene. The main reason to fork was not that I thought Serene was bad: I just wanted to try out Tailwind for a while and reimplementing a blog theme seemed like the perfect way to do so.

The main and pretty much only difference between Tranquil and Serene is that the styling is built from scratch with Tailwind. The icons have also been changed to align better with Tailwind.

## Usage

- Check the [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) of `main` branch.

## Contributing

- Before you make any non-trivial changes, consider opening an issue so we can discuss the change.

# zerm

a minimalist and dark theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org).

![Screenshot](../master/zerm-preview.png?raw=true)

[**Live Preview!**](https://zerm.ejmg.now.sh/)

Largely a port of Radek Kozieł's [Terminal
Theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) for Hugo. 4/5ths of my way
through porting this theme, I discovered Paweł Romanowski own independent fork
for Zola, [Terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal),
which helped me get the PostCSS to Sass styling conversion done more
quickly. My sincerest thanks to both of you!

## differences

This theme is largely true to the original by Radek, but there are some mild
differences. They are almost all stylistic in nature and are intended to
emphasize minimalism even more. Some of them are as follows:
- tags are now included in a post's meta data.
- no post image previews.
- categories are included in the taxonomy.
- bullet points have slightly more margin and different symbols for nesting.
- no social media or comment support.

Some of these might be added later and [PR's are always
welcomed](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm/pulls).

## configuration

Please follow the Zola documentation for [how to use a
theme](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#installing-a-theme).

In `config.toml`, you will find all values for customization that are supported
thus far have documentation explaining how they are used. If there is any confusion or something is not working as intended, [please open an issue](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm/issues)!

## math
You can use KaTeX for mathematical typesetting.
Assets are only available if you opt-in on a per-page level through
a single line (`math=true`) on the extra section of the page frontmatter.

``` md
# index.md
+++
title="this page title"
...

[extra]
math=true
+++

Content
```

Pages wich doesn't opt-in are not affected in any way, so you doesn't have
to worry about any performance hit.

## license

MIT. See `LICENSE.md` for more details.

description = "a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914"
```

### SEO

Most SEO tags are populated by the page metadata, but you can set the `author` and for the `og:image` tag provide the path to an image:

```toml
[extra]

author = "Timothy Morton"
og_image = "Hyperobjects.png"
```

### Menu

- With a small script for an elegant overlay menu
- Without any scripts at all (it just your show menu underneath)

![mobile menus](screenshot-mobile-menus.png)

### Social

Set a field in `extra` with a key of `footer_links`:

```toml
[extra]

# Freely comment out or delete every field
social_links = [
    {url = "https://t.me/yourname", name = "telegram"},
    {url = "https://twitter.com/gicrisf", name = "twitter"},
    {url = "https://github.com/gicrisf", name = "github"},
    # {url = "", name = "facebook"},
    # {url = "", name = "instagram"},
    # {url = "", name = "bookstack"},
    # {url = "", name = "dokuwiki"},
]
```

![social buttons](social-buttons.png)

The theme automatically picks up the right icons.
We can expand the support to other social, for sure: make a PR or open an enhancement issue to ask a new implementation.

### Footer

You can add your own copyright or whatever to the footer with a through a simple option on the config file:

```toml
[extra]

footer_tagline = "What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpet."
```

## Name

The name arise from two parts:
- The generator, Zola, gives the "Z";
- An extinct species of New Zealand wattlebird, the huia, provide the second part.

The theme is built on **Spectre** CSS framework, so I found reasonable evoking a **spectral species**.

## Genesis

This theme is based on a Pelican theme I originally made for my blog, which was in turn based on the 
Grav theme [Quark](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-quark).

# UI Navigation
UI Navigation, or known as zluinav, is a Zola theme designed for accessibility rather than visual and made as easy as possible using templates and macros. Since I am a blind developer, I'd like to develop with accessibility as possible so visually impaired users can use them.

This theme is also available for Hugo at [Hguinav](https://github.com/harrymkt/hguinav).

[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is a fast site generator written in Rust powered by tera as its templating engine and has a powerful theme creation feature.

[Theme demo](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav)

## License
This theme is distributed under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/harrymkt/zluinav/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Features of zluinav theme
- Accessibility; Zluinav is designed to be accessible as possible, especially for blind and visually impaired. This is done by using accessibility tags, such as ARIA, and other possible accessibility features.
- SEO friendly.
- Configuration; use an extensive [configuration](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs#extra-variables) parameters to control your site, from the main configuration file to [frontmadder configuration](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs/extra/frontmadder), and more.
- Blog with pagination enabled; multiple blogs can be created by copying the blog directory in the content folder to the new directory for a new blog. This means that you can have multiple blogs in one site. In fact, Zola doesn't have its build-in posts, but it is possible using sections. Please note that directory other than blog will require you to manually set the `template` to `blogpage.html` and `page_template` to `section_paginated.html` in its `_index.md` file.
- Documentation site; build accessible [documentation sites](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs/documentation) by using built-in 1subsection templates specifically designed for documentation.
- Multilingual; build your site in multiple languages.
- [Custom Menu](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs/extra/config#menus) support.
- Taxonomies support.
- Built-in [search](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs/search) support, with a variety of search formats to choose.
- Customizable extrahead, header, navigation, and footer by base templates and blocks.
- Copy code blocks; add code blocks which can then be copied using buttons and display the code language if available, helped by JavaScript.
- Variables; add [variables](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs/writing) to your page content to be replaced during the site generate.
- Local date display; display dates in user's local timezone, no madder what timezone the date is set.
- Use extensive macros and shortcodes to make your content length shorten.
- Ability to toggle the use of JavaScript for both config and per-page frontmadder.
- Comprehensive documentation; Zluinav provides a full Comprehensive documentation including possible templates, shortcodes, blocks, configurable parameters, and more, everything as it updates.

## Installation
Using git clone:
```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/harrymkt/zluinav.git
```
Or [download manually](https://github.com/harrymkt/zluinav/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and paste in the themes directory.

Or, add to the Git submodule (recommended):
```bash
git submodule add --name zluinav https://github.com/harrymkt/zluinav.git themes/zluinav
git submodule update --remote

```toml
theme = "zluinav"
```

## Customization
For more customizable options and configurations, please see [documentation](https://harrymkt.github.io/zluinav/docs)

## Contribution
Contributions to this theme are welcome, provided that the following requirements are met:
- Use 2 level space indentation for HTML. Use 1 tab level indentation for CSS and JavaScript. If Markdown files need indentation, use 1 tab.
- Be the templates accessible for visually impaired and/or blind and prefer readability. Don't worry, I will process in case accessibility issues before pull requests are merged.
- Photos are not required in this theme. You may design with CSS for visual if you so wish.
- When creating a pull request it is advised that you:
	- Use different branch other than main; this avoids issues with updating in case your pull request gets rejected.

## An easy way to create a document library for your project

Demo: [https://easydocs.codeandmedia.com/](https://easydocs.codeandmedia.com/)

This theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org) (static site engine) helps you build and publish your project docs easily and fast. Zola is just one binary that outputs html-pages and additional static assets after building your docs written in Markdown. Thus, you can take the theme, your md-files, Zola and gain flexible and simple website for documentation. 

### Step-by-step

As you may have heard Zola is quite flexible :) So, the scenario below is one of hundreds possible ways to make things done, feel free to find your best. Also, Zola provides their own mechanism to install and use themes, see [the docs](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/). 

1. Fork the repo and replace demo-content inside content folder with yours. But take a look to _index.md files. It contains `title` and when you want to have anchor right of your headers add `insert_anchor_links = "right"` to each index. `theme.toml`, screenshot and readme may be deleted too. 
2. Inside `config.toml` change URL and title on your own. In extra section you can specify path to your GitHub API for version below the logo on nav, favicon and logo itself. Or just remove the lines if you don't need it. Also, you can configure or turn on some additional settings related to Zola. [Specification is here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/).
3. In sass/_variables.scss you may change font, color or background if you want.
4. Almost done. Now, you should decide how you want to build and where will be hosted your website. You can build it locally and upload to somewhere. Or build in GitHub Actions and host on GitHub Pages / Netlify / CloudFlare Pages / AnyS3CloudStorage. [Howto for GitHub Pages](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/). [My example](https://github.com/o365hq/o365hq.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) of GitHub workflow with 2-steps build (the first checks for links and spelling errors, the second uploads to Azure). [Dockerfile](https://github.com/codeandmedia/zola_docsascode_theme/blob/master/Dockerfile) to make Docker image.

## Provided configurations options

These options can be configured in the `extra` section of the [config.toml](config.toml).
If any are not present it has the same behaviour as the default which is shown in the starter [config.toml](config.toml).

- **easydocs_logo_always_clickable** controls if the logo is always clickable. By default the logo is only clickable if you are not on the home page. If this is enabled it will make the logo clickable when you are on the home page as well. Thus on the home page it will basically just refresh the page as it will take you to the same page.
- **easydocs_uglyurls** provides support for offline sites that do not use a webserver. If set to true links in the nav are generated with the full path indcluding `index.html`. This functionality was  insired by [Abridge theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/abridge/). Note that for this to work it also requries the base URL to be set to the local folder where the site will be stored eg. `base_url = file:///home/user/mysite/public/`. Therefore this is not portable and only works with a specific local folder, but does not require a webserver to navigate the site.
- **easydocs_heading_threshold** controls minimum number of headings needed on a page before the headings show in the navigation on the left. Defaults to 5. Can be used for example to always show headings on each page by setting it to 1.

Enjoy your docs!

**[Live Demo](https://zola-folio.pages.dev/)**

## Features

- [x] Menu bar
- [x] Social links
- [x] Tags
- [x] MathJax
- [x] Search
- [x] Customizable color
- [x] SEO tags
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Installation

In the git repo of your zola site:

### Add the theme as a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/evjrob/zola-folio themes/zola-folio
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

### Or clone the theme directly into your themes directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evjrob/zola-folio themes/zola-folio
```

Then set `theme = "zola-folio"` in your config.toml file. You can now test the theme locally by running `zola serve` in the terminal and navigating to the localhost URL displayed by the command.

## Configuration

### Menu Bar

Items in the top menu bar can be controlled with the `extra.menu_items` setting in config.toml:

```toml
menu_items = [
    {name = "about", url = "/pages/about"},
    {name = "projects", url = "/pages/projects"},
    {name = "photography", url = "/pages/photography"},
]
```

### About Page Social Contacts

If you have an about page, you can add social contact links using the `extra.socials` setting in the frontmatter of the page:

```toml
+++
title = "about"
template = "about.html"
[extra]
socials = [
	{name = "email", uri = "mailto:you@example.com"},
	{name = "github", uri = "https://github.com"},
	{name = "instagram", uri = "https://www.instagram.com/"},
	{name = "bluesky", uri = "https://bsky.app/"}
]
+++
```

### MathJax

MathJax can be enabled by setting `extra.math` in config.toml:

```toml
[extra]
math = true
```
[Example](https://zola-folio.pages.dev/math/).

### Search

Search using elasticlunr.js:

```toml
default_language = "en"
build_search_index = true

[search]
include_title = true
include_description = true
include_path = true
include_content = true
index_format = "elasticlunr_json"
```

### Customizable Colors

Simply set the `extra.theme_color` in the config.toml:

```toml
[extra]
theme_color = "red"|"blue"|"green"|"purple"
```
If the existing colors are not to your liking, then you can create your own by adding a **sass/color/custom.scss** file with the following:

```scss
:root {
    --theme-color: #ffffff;
    --theme-color-light: #ffffff;
}
```
Then set `theme_color = "custom"`.

### SEO Tags

The typical `<meta>` tags including Open Graph and Twitter are automatically set for posts using the information in the frontmatter of each post. To ensure an image is set for Open Graph and Twitter cards, please ensure the frontmatter contains the `extra.feature_image` value:

```toml
[extra]
feature_image = "my_image.ext"
```

## Demo

[Live Demo](https://mattimustang.github.io/zola-grayscale/)

## How to Customize

The majority of customisation is done through template inheritance.
Every section and subsection of the page has a template `{%/* block */%}` that you
can override with your own content.


Start by copying `themes/zola-grayscale/contact.toml` and
`themes/zola-grayscale/navigation.toml` to your site root folder.

Then create your own site `templates/index.html` with the following contents:

```html
{%/* extends "zola-grayscale/templates/index.html" */%}
```

If you don't want a particular section in your page override it with an empty
block, for example this will remove the `about` section of the page:

```html
{%/* block about */%}{%/* endblock about */%}
```

### Configuration

The `config.toml` file has some basic configuration used by the page including:

* title
* author
* description
* google_analytics_tag (optional)
* sb_forms_api_token

### Navigation

The page navigation is customised through the `navigation.toml` file.
Edit this file to change the names and paths to link to.
You can add additional `item`'s and they will be automatically added to the
navigation bar.

The home link in the left of the navigation bar uses `config.title` by default
or can be customised with the `nav_home_title` block.

```html
{%/* block nav_home_title */%}Home{%/* endblock nav_home_title */%}
```

### Contacts

The contacts section of the page is managed via in the `contacts.toml` which has
two types of items:

* `contact` for the contact cards.
* `social` for the social network links.

Modifying, adding, or removing items from these lists will automatically update
that section of the page.
Both contact item types use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io/icons/) icons
for their `icon` value.

### Masthead

The entire `masthead` section can be overridden with your own markup like so:

```html
{%/* block masthead */%}
...
{%/* endblock masthead */%}
```

The following sub-blocks are provided for further customisation:

* `masthead_title`:
  defaults to `config.title`
* `masthead_description`:
  defaults to `config.description`
* `masthead_button`
* `masthead_button_url`
* `masthead_button_tag`
* `masthead_button_label`

#### Background Image

The background image of the `masthead` can be changed by creating the directory
`static/assets/img` copying your own image to
`static/assets/img/bg-masthead.jpg` in your own site.

### Content

A `content` block wraps the About](#about), [Projects sections of
the page to allow you to completely replace the content of the page with your
own markup.

```html
{%/* block content */%}
...
{%/* endblock content */%}
```

### About

The entire `about` section can be overridden with your own markup like so:

```html
{%/* block about */%}
...
{%/* endblock about */%}
```

The following sub-blocks are provided for further customisation:

* `about_title`
* `about_description`
* `about_image`

### Projects

The entire `projects` section can be overridden with your own markup like so:

```html
{%/* block projects */%}
...
{%/* endblock projects */%}
```

The section has these sub-blocks:

* `projects_id`:
  set the html id attribute for the projects section.
* `featured_project` with these sub-blocks for customisation:

    * `featured_project_thumbnail`:
      Allows overriding the markup of the project thumbnail.
    * `featured_project_content`:
      Allows overriding the markup of the project content.
    * `featured_project_title`
    * `featured_project_description`

* `project_1` with these sub-blocks for customisation:

    * `project_1_thumbnail`:
      Allows overriding the markup of the project thumbnail.
    * `project_1_content`:
      Allows overriding the markup of the project content.
    * `project_1_title`
    * `project_1_description`

* `project_2` with these sub-blocks for customisation:

    * `project_2_thumbnail`:
      Allows overriding the markup of the project thumbnail.
    * `project_2_content`:
      Allows overriding the markup of the project content.
    * `project_2_title`
    * `project_2_description`

* `extra_projects` to add extra content as you wish.

### Signup

The entire `signup` section can be overridden with your own markup like so:

```html
{%/* block signup */%}
...
{%/* endblock signup */%}
```

The following sub-blocks are provided for further customisation:

* `signup_id`:
  set the html id attribute for the signup section.
* `signup_icon`:
  the Font Awesome icon to use.
* `signup_title`
* `signup_form`

### Contact

The entire `contact` section can be overridden with your own markup like so:

```html
{%/* block contact */%}
...
{%/* endblock contact */%}
```

The following sub-blocks are provided for further customisation:

* `contact_id`:
  set the html id attribute for the contact section.
* `contact_contact`
* `contact_social`

### Footer

The entire `footer` section can be overridden with your own markup like so:

```html
{%/* block footer */%}
...
{%/* endblock footer */%}
```

The following sub-blocks are provided for further customisation:

* `footer_copyright`
* `footer_debug`:
  customise the debug macro call.
* `extra_footer`:
  to add extra content as you wish.

## Macros

### Debug

The `debug` macro can be used by setting `config.extra.debug` to `true`.
This will then add a `debug` button to the footer of the page to allow you to
inspect, by default, the `__tera_context` in a pop-out sidebar.

If you want to debug other context information you can customise it like so.
For example, to debug the `config` context:

```html
{%/* block footer_debug */%}{{/* debug::debug(context=config, name="config") */}}{%/* endblock footer_debug */%}
```

### Title

The `title` macro can be used to set the title for any additional pages you
might create.

### Google Analytics

The `google_analytics` macro can be used to insert code for Google Analytics.
Set `config.extra.google_analytics_tag` to your tag id.

## Misc

The `extra_head` block can be used to add extra markup to the end of the
`<head>` of the page.
The `extra_scripts` block can be used to add extra scripts to the end of the
page.

`static/css/custom.css` can be created and used to add any custom CSS.

# Hacker theme for Zola

Zola Hacker is a minimalistic theme for Zola, inspired by the [Hacker theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/hacker/) for Jekyll. It is designed for developers who want to write blogs.

## Demo

[Live Preview](https://zola-hacker.enginerd.io/).

## Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ 0.19.1.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:en9inerd/zola-hacker.git
cd zola-hacker
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

## Installation

Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to
install the theme in an existing site step by step.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install Zola Hacker Theme

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone git@github.com:en9inerd/zola-hacker.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd mysite
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add git@github.com:en9inerd/zola-hacker.git themes/hacker
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Enable the theme in your `config.toml` in the site directory:

```toml
theme = "hacker"
```

Or copy the `config.toml` from the theme directory to your project's
root directory:

```bash
cp themes/hacker/config.toml config.toml
```

### Step 4: Add new content

You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```bash
cp -r themes/hacker/content .
```

You can modify or add new posts in the `content/posts`, `content/pages` or other
content directories as needed.

### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

Command will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## Customisation

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `theme.toml`, `content` files and templates files in this
repo for an idea.

### Global Configuration

There are some configuration options that you can customize in `config.toml`.

#### Configuration options before `extra` options

Set the tags taxonomy in the `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    { name = "tags" },
]
```

#### Configuration options under the `extra`

The following options should be under the `[extra]` in `config.toml`

- `language_code` - set HTML file language (default to `en-US`)
- `title_separator` - the separator to your site title, like `|` and `-` (defaults to `|`)
- `logo` - path to the logo image
- `google_analytics` - Google Analytics tracking ID
- `timeformat` - the timeformat for the blog article published date
- `timezone` - the timezone for the blog article published date
- `edit_page` - whether to show the edit page in the github repo for your posts
- `menu` - set the menu items for your site
- `contact_form_script_id` - the script id for the contact form based on [Google Script](https://github.com/en9inerd/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server)
- `[extra.github]` - set the GitHub metadata for your site
- `[extra.giscus]` - set the Giscus settings for your site to enable the comments. Please use own settings from the [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) website
- `[extra.opengraph]` - set the Open Graph metadata for your site
- `[extra.pgp_key]` - set pgp key in the footer for certain pages
- `social_links` - set the social media links in the footer
...

### Templates

All pages are extend to the `base.html`, and you can customize them as need.

### Shortcodes

The theme provides some shortcodes to help you write your content:

`contact_form`
The `contact_form` shortcode is based on [Google Apps Mail](https://github.com/en9inerd/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server) to send emails without a server.
It depends on `contact_form_script_id` in the `config.toml`.

```markdown
{{/* contact_form() */}}
```

`cv`
The `cv` shortcode is used to display the CV in the page. Data for CV is stored in yaml format in the `data/cv` directory.

```markdown
{{/* cv() */}}
```

`github_avatar`
The `github_avatar` shortcode is used to display the GitHub avatar image. It depends on `extra.github.username` in the `config.toml`. Also, you can pass size as an argument.

```markdown
{{/* github_avatar(size=100) */}}
```

`projects`
The `projects` shortcode is used to display repositories from GitHub. It depends on `extra.github.username` in the `config.toml` and `extra.repo_names` in page front matter to filter the repositories.

```markdown
{{/* projects() */}}
```

![screenshot for posts](screenshot-post.png)

![screenshot for any other page](screenshot-page.png)

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```sh
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/sirodoht/zola-henry.git henry
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "henry"
```

## Options

### Nav links

Set a field in `extra` with a key of `henry_links`:

```toml
[extra]
henry_links = [
    {url = "about", name = "About"},
    {url = "https://github.com/benbalter", name = "GitHub"},
]
```

Each link needs to have a `url` and a `name`.

### Footer GitHub icon link

```toml
[extra]
henry_github = "https://github.com/sirodoht/zola-henry"
```

### Footer Twitter icon link

Twitter is too mainstream and a bit lame, but 100% of our users have requested, so we offer it.

```toml
[extra]
henry_twitter = "https://twitter.com/benbalter"
```

[Minimal](https://zola-minimal.vercel.app/) is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme with the goal of helping you build a light, fast, and SEO ready landing page or website.

It is based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme with [the same name](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).

Check out the [demo](https://zola-minimal.vercel.app/).

![theme screenshot](screenshot.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ v0.18.0.

```sh
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/zola-minimal.git

# 2. Change directory into clone
cd zola-minimal

# 3. Serve the site locally
zola serve

# 4. Open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

## 🎨 Customization

You can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the [config.toml](config.toml), and [templates](templates) for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of [config.toml](config.toml) to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to [sass/_custom.scss](sass/_custom.scss). This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.

## 🚩 Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for **Minimal**. Please search [existing issues](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-minimal/issues). It’s possible someone has already reported the same problem. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [open a new issue](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-minimal/issues/new).

# Zola-Paper
A clean theme inspired from hugo-paper.

[Zola](https://getzola.org) port of [Hugo-Paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper/) (with a few tweaks).

**Demo:** [https://schoenenberg.github.com/zola-paper](https://schoenenberg.github.com/zola-paper)

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)
![Dark Mode Screenshot](screenshot_dark.png)

## Installation

The easiest way to install this theme is to either clone it ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schoenenberg/zola-paper.git themes/zola-paper
```

... or to use it as a submodule.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/schoenenberg/zola-paper.git themes/zola-paper
```

Either way, you will have to enable the theme in your `config.toml`.

```toml
theme = "zola-paper"
```

## Open Graph Integration

This theme has an integration of Open Graph *meta* tags. These are set based on context and available information. See the following example:

```markdown
+++
title = "Lorem ipsum!"

[extra]
author = "Max Mustermann"
author_url = "https://www.facebook.com/example.profile.3"
banner_path = "default-banner"

[taxonomies]
tags = ["rust", "zola", "blog"]
+++

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc eu feugiat sapien. Aenean ligula nunc, laoreet id sem in, interdum bibendum felis. Donec vel dui neque.
<!-- more -->
Ut luctus dolor ut tortor hendrerit, sed hendrerit augue scelerisque. Suspendisse quis sodales dui, at tempus ante. Nulla at tempor metus. Aliquam vitae rutrum diam. Curabitur iaculis massa dui, quis varius nulla finibus a. Praesent eu blandit justo. Suspendisse pharetra, arcu in rhoncus rutrum, magna magna viverra erat, ...

```

Required attributes of the `extra` section is `author`. All other attributes are optional. The path for the `banner_path` attribute has to be relative to the content directory.

## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/lukehsiao/zola-pickles.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "zola-pickles"
```

The theme requires putting the posts in the root of the `content` folder and to enable pagination, for example in `content/_index.md`.

```
+++
paginate_by = 5
sort_by = "date"
insert_anchor_links = "right"
+++
```

## Reference guides

## Configuration Options

```toml
[extra]
# A line to display underneath the main title
subtitle = "Example subtitle"

# Text to display in the footer of the page
copyright = "Copyright authors year"

# Your Google Analytics ID
analytics = ""

# See below
katex_enable = false

# See below
instantpage_enable = false
```

A full example configuration is included in config.toml.

Note how pickles also expects `title` and `description` to also be set in the Zola configuration.

### KaTeX math formula support

This theme contains math formula support using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), which can be enabled by setting `katex_enable = true` in the `extra` section of `config.toml`.

After enabling this extension, the `katex` short code can be used in documents:
* `{%/* katex(block=true) */%}\KaTeX{%/* end */%}` to typeset a block of math formulas,
  similar to `$$...$$` in LaTeX

### Figure Shortcode

The figure shortcode is convenient for captioning figures.

```
{%/* figure(link="https://www.example.com/", src="https://www.example.com/img.jpeg", alt="sample alt text") */%}
Your caption here.
{%/* end */%}
```

### Table Shortcode

The table shortcode is convenient for making mobile-friendly tables (centered with overflow scrollbar).

```
{%/* table() */%}
| Item         | Price | # In stock |
| :----------- | ----: | ---------: |
| Juicy Apples |  1.99 |        739 |
| Bananas      |  1.89 |          6 |
{%/* end */%}
```

### Fontawesome

This theme includes fontawesome, so that fontawesome icons can be directly used.

### Instant.page

The theme contains instant.page prefetching. This can be enabled by setting `instantpage_enable = true` in the `extra` section of `config.toml`.

## Showing article summaries

By default, the theme will use the first 280 characters of your post as a summary, if a proper [page summary](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/#summary) using `<!-- more -->` is not provided.
For more sensible summaries, we recommend using the manual more indicator.

# Zola Theme : Course

This theme allows you to publish only courses/tutorials structured in
parts and subparts, using Zola.

![Homepage of the demo](screenshot.png)

![Page of a course](screenshot2.png)

It automatically links pages of the course with the next and previous ones
for easy navigation. There is also a navigation bar at the top of each page
to easily navigate the whole tutorial, and for the reader to never be lost.

Each page can have an illustration.

It lets you customize some parts of the site, like the color palette.

It also features a light/dark mode switcher.

It also has some SEO features.

It was made for french courses, so a few parts of the interface may be in french.
You can easily adapt it to your language by editing the files in `themes/zola-theme-course/templates/`.

## Usage

Create your Zola site, and import this theme:

```bash
zola init NAME
cd NAME/themes
git clone https://github.com/elegaanz/zola-theme-course.git
cd ..
```

Then update your `config.toml` with this line:

```toml
theme = "zola-theme-course"
```

You can also add these lines to customize how the theme behaves:

```toml
[extra]
site_name = "My course"
icon = "image.png"
icon_desc = "Icon of the course"
description = "A great course!"
default_illus = "illus.png"
primary_color = "#FFFFFF"
accent_color = "#FFFFFF"
source_url = "https://github.com/me/my-course"
```

### File structure

For your course to be displayed correctly, it needs to follow a specific structure.

- `content/_index.md` is the text displayed on the homepage
- each part should have its own folder, with an `_index.md`
- each subpart should have its own markdown file (which can be an `index.md` in a subfolder)
- all `_index.md` files should have `sort_by = "weight"` in their frontmatter, and you can then
  order parts and subparts using the `weight` option.

With this theme, pages can also have extra options:

```toml
[extra]
# Don't display the page title, useful for the homepage
no_title = true
# The name of the image to use as a banner
illus = "illus.jpg"
# Adds JSON-LD metadata on this page, useful for the homepage
jsonld = true
```

The standard `title` and `description` fields are also taken into account.

# Terminimal

[![Build Status](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)
![No JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-none-brightgreen.svg)

![Screenshot](../master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

See the live demo (of the default configuration) here:
https://pawroman.github.io/zola-theme-terminimal/

Tested with Zola v0.19.2.

Please note that earlier (and older) versions might not work because of breaking changes across Zola versions.

#### Fork disclaimer

This theme is a fork (not a port) of "Terminal" Hugo theme
by Radosław Kozieł (aka. panr):
https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal

Many thanks for that outstanding original theme, Radek!

For more information about this fork and the differences to the original theme, please see:
Changes compared to the original theme below.

## Versioning

This theme used to be non-versioned, e.g. you'd pull the master branch, and occasionally new features or fixes would
be released.

Starting from version v1.0.0, the project adopted [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Please check the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/releases) to see a change log
and work out if there's any breaking changes.

## How to start

Option A: clone the theme directly into your Zola site folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal.git themes/terminimal
```

Option B: include it as a git submodule (it's better if you plan to use CI builders):

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal.git themes/terminimal
```

Then in your `config.toml` set:

```toml
theme = "terminimal"

# Sass compilation is required
compile_sass = true
```

Also see the Zola documentation on using themes:
https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/

## Shortcodes

The theme adds two custom shortcodes related to image handling.

### `image`

Used to show images.

Required arguments:

- **`src`**

Optional arguments:

- **`alt`**
- **`position`** (center \[default\] | left | right)
- **`style`**

Example:

```
{{/* image(src="/img/hello.png", alt="Hello Friend",
         position="left", style="border-radius: 8px;") */}}
```
  
### `figure`

Same as `image`, but with a few extra optional arguments:

- **`caption`** (supports markdown)
- **`caption_position`** (center \[default\] | left | right)
- **`caption_style`**

Example:

```
{{/* figure(src="http://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-flat-gesture.png",
          style="width: 25%;",
          position="right",
          caption_position="left",
          caption="**Ferris**, the (unofficial) Rust mascot",
          caption_style="font-style: italic;") */}}
```

## OpenGraph

To add an image to a post, set the `og_image` extra option to the desired image
in the same directory of the markdown file:

```toml
[extra]
og_image = "colocated_image.png"
```

Additionally, for the section pages and for posts to have a fallback image, add
`default_og_image` to the `[extra]` section:

```toml
[extra]
default_og_image = "static/ocean.jpg"
```

## Configuration

### Only show the post's description

On each post you can specify the following:

```toml
description = "test description"

[extra]
show_only_description = true
```

This will render `test description` under this
particular post on the homepage instead of a summary.

### Colors

Both the accent colors and background colors are
configurable.

By default, both accent and background are set
to `blue`.

To configure menu, add this in `[extra]` section
of your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# One of: blue, green, orange, pink, red.
# Defaults to blue.
# Append -light for light themes, e.g. blue-light
# Or append -auto, e.g. blue-auto
accent_color = "green"

# One of: blue, dark, green, orange, pink, red, light, auto
# Enabling dark background will also modify primary font color to be darker.
# Defaults to accent color (or, if not accent color specified, to blue).
background_color = "dark"
```

### Logo text and link

You can set the "logo" text and what it links to,
by modifying `config.toml` like so:

```toml
[extra]

# The logo text - defaults to "Terminimal theme"
logo_text = "My blog"

# The logo link - defaults to base_url.
logo_home_link = "/take/me/away!"
```

### Author and copyright

You can set the footer's copyright author name like this:

```toml
[extra]

# Author name: when specified, modifies the default
# copyright text. Apart from author, it will
# contain current year and a link to the theme.
author = "My Name"
``` 

If you don't like the default copyright text,
you can set it to completely custom HTML:

```toml
[extra]

# Copyright text in HTML format. If specified,
# entirely replaces default copyright and author.
copyright_html = "My custom&nbsp;<b>copyright</b>"
```

### Menu

The menu is optional, static (all items are always shown,
no matter what the screen size) and fully user-configurable.

To configure menu, add this in `[extra]` section
of your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# menu is enabled by adding menu_items (optional)
menu_items = [
    # each of these is optional, name and url are required
    # $BASE_URL is going to be substituted by base_url from configuration
    {name = "blog", url = "$BASE_URL"},
    
    # tags should only be enabled if you have "tags" taxonomy
    # see documentation below for more details
    {name = "tags", url = "$BASE_URL/tags"},
    {name = "archive", url = "$BASE_URL/archive"},
    {name = "about me", url = "$BASE_URL/about"},
    
    # set newtab to true to make the link open in new tab
    {name = "github", url = "url-to-your-github", newtab = true},
]
```

### Tags

The theme optionally supports tags. To enable them, create
a "tags" taxonomy in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    {name = "tags"},
]
```

Enabling tags will create a new `/tags` page, and 
cause them to show up in `archive` section. Note
that you still need to create a menu link to the tags
page manually.

### Pagination

Pagination is fully supported for post list (main site)
and intra-post (you can navigate to earlier and later posts).

To make sure pagination works properly, you must first configure
it in `content/_index.md`:

```
+++
# number of pages to paginate by
paginate_by = 2

# sorting order for pagination
sort_by = "date"
+++
```

Then, tweak the theme's pagination config in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# Whether to show links to earlier and later posts
# on each post page (defaults to true).
enable_post_view_navigation = true

# The text shown at the bottom of a post,
# before earlier/later post links.
# Defaults to "Thanks for reading! Read other posts?"
post_view_navigation_prompt = "Read more"
```

### Language code

Internationalization / translation is not supported
but you can set the HTML language code for your
site:

```toml
default_language = "en"
```

### Hack font subset

By default, the theme uses a mixed subset of the Hack font.
Normal weight font uses full character set
(for Unicode icons and special symbols), but all others
(bold, italic etc) use a limited subset.

This results in much smaller transfer sizes, but the subset
might not contain all the Unicode characters you need.

You can enable full unicode support in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# Use full Hack character set, not just a subset.
# Switch this to true if you need full unicode support.
# Defaults to false.
use_full_hack_font = true
```

Also see [Hack's docs](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/docs/WEBFONT_USAGE.md).

### Favicon

The theme supports adding a global favicon (applies to
all pages) to the site:

```toml
# Optional: Global favicon URL and mimetype.
#           Mimetype defaults to "image/x-icon".
#           The URL should point at a file located
#           in your site's "static" directory.
favicon = "/favicon.png"
favicon_mimetype = "image/png"
```

### Page titles

The theme allows you to configure how the page titles (the `<title>` elements) are rendered.

Use `"combined"` to render titles as `"Page title | Main title"`.

```toml
# Optional: Set how <title> elements are rendered.
# Values:
# - "main_only" -- only the main title (`config.title`) is rendered.
# - "page_only" -- only the page title (if defined) is rendered,
#                  falling back to `config.title` if not defined or empty.
# - "combined" -- combine like so: "page_title | main_title",
#                 or if page_title is not defined or empty, fall back to `main_title`
#
# Note that the main (index) page only has the main title.
page_titles = "combined"
```

All the configuration options are also described in
[`config.toml`](../master/config.toml).

## Extending

Each of the templates defines named blocks, so
it should be quite easy to customize the most common things.

For example, if you want to add extra `<meta>` tags to the
base template, `index.html`, create file like this in `templates/index.html`:

```html
{%/* extends "terminimal/templates/index.html" */%}

{%/* block extra_head */%}
    <meta name="description" content="My awesome website"/>
    <meta name="keywords" content="Hacking,Programming,Ranting"/>
{%/* endblock */%}
```

## How to contribute

If you spot any bugs or wish to contribute new features, please create a new
[Pull Request](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/pulls).

## Changes compared to the original theme

This theme has been forked from https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal

- Slight changes in the layout and styling.
  - Content has been centered (instead of left-aligned).
  - The header stripes have been spaced out.
  - Tweaks to pagination, especially on mobile (small screens).
  - The post title underline is dashed instead of doubly-dotted.
  - All links are underlined, as per
    [Brutalist Web Design Guidelines](https://www.brutalist-web.design/).
  - Tweaks to header font sizes.
  - Minor footer tweaks.

- Absolutely **no JavaScript**.
  - No JavaScript needed to pre-process anything.
    Zola with its Sass pre-processor is the only dependency.
  - There's no menu trigger.
  - Things load crazy fast, as it's all static content.
  - Prism.js syntax highlighting is not supported (you can use
    [Zola's](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/syntax-highlighting/)).

- All references to social media (e.g. Twitter) have been removed.

- All references to external URLs (e.g. Google CDN) have been removed.
  This theme's static assets are meant to be served from where it's hosted.

- [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) is the default font.

- The default color theme is blue (original uses orange).

### New features

- You can pick the accent color as well as background color.
  There's a new `dark` background. See Configuration
  below for details.
- Active "section" links will change color indicating the
  active section. This is all static, done at template level.

### Features retained from the original

- 5 color themes, depending on your preference:
  blue (default), green, orange, pink, red.
- The shortcodes `image` and `figure` (See Shortcodes.
- Fully responsive.

# ZOLA.386

![ZOLA.386 screenshot](https://github.com/lopes/zola.386/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## [Live demo](https://zola386.netlify.app/)

ZOLA.386 is a port of the BOOTSTRA.386 theme and was based on:

- [BOOTSTRA.386](https://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/): main idea, design.
- [HUGO.386](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo.386/): item placement.
- [Dinkleberg](https://github.com/rust-br/dinkleberg): internal structure and SEO.
- [after-dark](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark): navbar and minor components.

ZOLA.386 is a theme that refers to the 90s, but with cutting edge features to be fast and responsive.


## Installation
The easiest way to install ZOLA.386 is to clone this repository and build your site upon it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lopes/zola.386
```

Of course you can install it just as another theme for your site, but ZOLA.386 must be added as a module:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git submodule add https://github.com/lopes/zola.386 
```


## Configuration
Configuration is mainly done in `config.toml` and here I'll describe the main topics.

### Global
`config.toml` starts with the global variables.  All of these items are important, but it is fundamental to create two taxonomies at least:

```toml
taxonomies = [
  {name="categories", rss=true},
  {name="tags", rss=true},
]
```

Remember that all descriptions (`config.description` and `page.description`) are shown on the index page, one at the header and the others through the body.

### Extras
ZOLA.386 comes with a lot of extra variables which eases the creation and maintenance of the site, so it's important to review all of them after installing the theme.

The `zola386_menu` composes the navbar and is created by setting up a `path`, which will be appended to the `base_url` and the `name` will appear on the navbar.

```toml
zola386_menu = [
  {path="/", name="Home"},
  {path="categories", name="Categories"},
  {path="tags", name="Tags"},
  {path="about", name="About"},
]
```

### Social
ZOLA.386 is also prepared to deal with Google Analytics, Disqus, and Twitter --[Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) is welcome.  This theme is prepared to use the output of [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/), to do so, you'll just need to download the output of that site and extract in `static/images`. 

As said, Disqus is supported, but besides setting the username in `config.toml`, you also must to put a `comments = true` extra option on the pages where Disqus will be enabled --this gives you the freedom to enable or disable comments on certain posts.  You can use the extra option `image` on each page, to represent that post.

### Animations
All JavaScript animations can be set at `static/js/zola386.js`.  Basically you can disable all animations, use one or two scans, and change the scan speed.  Personally, I prefer only one scan with a speed factor of 5.

### Language
Under the `label_` variables, you can set names to better localize your site.  Note that you can change the language of a single page, by using `page.extra.lang`, which causes `<html lang="">` to change only on that page.  A theme to provide information for its owner and SEO-friendly.

### Search
Search was implemented according to the [official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/search/).  It uses JavaScript to search on an indexed version of the site based on `search_index.LANG.js`, `elasticlunr.min.js`, and `search.js` --the first two are generated after each build.  If you're running your site in other default language other than English, you **must** change the `search_index.LANG.js` line in `index.html`, setting up `LANG` accordingly.

### Other files
The `content\_index.md` file must be properly configured to provide better experience.  Check out this file for more information.

The 404 page is almost hardcoded, so you must edit it directly.

# The Zolarwind Theme for Zola

Welcome to Zolarwind, the simple Zola blog theme with Tailwind CSS and KaTex support.
This theme is for Zola users aiming to have a nice blog design powered by Tailwind CSS.
It seamlessly integrates with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org), enabling the creation of various diagrams
directly within your blog posts using a Markdown-inspired syntax.
Additionally, the theme smoothly integrates math formulas using [KaTex](https://katex.org).
Most importantly, while the theme is designed to be easily localizable,
you can choose your preferred language setting for a consistent blog experience.

---

## Features:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilize the utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- **Mermaid Integration**: Create diverse diagrams using simple text.

- **KaTex Integration**: Integrate and display math formulas seamlessly in your blog posts.

- **Localization Support**: All theme-specific strings are available in multiple languages; choose the one that's right for you.
  If your language isn't supported yet, just create the resource file with your translations.

## Demo Website

You can see the theme in action on my [personal website](https://pureandroid.com).
The site uses the German language.

---

## Prerequisites

To use the theme, you need some software pre-installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), Required for version control.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download), an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
  Node is optional and only needed if you want to change the CSS in `css/main.css`.

- [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases), a fast static site generator.

- an editor or integrated development environment of your choice —
  I use [JetBrains IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download),
  an IDE that makes development a more productive and enjoyable experience. 

---

## Installation

1. Clone this theme repository with e.g. `git@github.com:thomasweitzel/zolarwind.git`.
   Or download it from `https://github.com/thomasweitzel/zolarwind`.

2. Make adjustments to the `config.toml` file as needed.
   To run the theme as a standalone site, you need to adjust the `base_url` to your domain.
   If you want to try it out on your local machine, you can leave it as is.
   Just run `zola serve` from the theme's root directory. 

---

## Configuration

Your `config.toml` file is crucial in customizing the Zola site.
Here's a breakdown of the configuration settings tailored for this theme:

### Basic Configuration:

- **base_url**: Specify the URL the site will be built for.
  In this case, the site will be built for `https://example.org`.
  Adjust this to your own domain.

- **compile_sass**: Determines whether to automatically compile all Sass files present in the `sass` directory.
  Here, it's set to `false`, meaning Sass files won't be automatically compiled for this theme.

- **default_language**: Sets the default language for the site.
  The provided config uses English (`en`) as the default language.
  As of now, German (`de`) is available in the `i18n` directory.

- **theme**: The theme used for the site.
  The provided line is commented out, indicating that the theme's files are taken from the `template` directory.
  If you move the theme to the `themes/zolarwind` directory, use `zolarwind` for this entry.

- **build_search_index**: If set to `true`, a search index will be built from the pages and section content for the `default_language`.
  In this configuration and for this theme, it's disabled (`false`).

- **generate_feed**: Determines if an Atom feed (file `atom.xml`) is automatically generated.
  It's set to `true`, meaning a feed will be generated.

- **taxonomies**: An array of taxonomies (classification systems) used for the site.
  Here, a taxonomy for `tags` is defined, with a pagination limit of 6 and an enabled feed.

### Markdown Configuration:

- **highlight_code**: Indicates whether code snippets in Markdown files should be highlighted. Here, it's set to `true`.

- **highlight_theme**: Specifies the theme to be used for code highlighting. The chosen theme in this configuration is `1337`.

- **extra_syntaxes_and_themes**: directory for additional syntax highlighting configuration files for languages not directly supported by Zola.

### Extra Configuration:

The `[extra]` section is where you can place any custom variables you want to be accessible in your templates.

- **title**: Required.
  The title of the site.
  Here, it's set to "Zolarwind."

- **path_language_resources**: Required.
  The path to the directory containing language resource files.
  In this config, it's set to `i18n/`.
  If you move the theme to the `themes/zolarwind` directory, use `themes/zolarwind/i18n/` for this entry.

- **generator**: Optional.
  Specify the generator used for creating the static website.
  This site is generated using `Zola v0.19.0`.

- **favicon_svg**: Optional.
  Provides a path to the site's favicon in SVG format.
  The provided path points to `/img/yin-yang.svg`.

- **copyright**: Optional.
  A template for the copyright notice.
  It includes a placeholder `{year}` which is dynamically replaced with the current year of your `zola build` run.

- **site_description**: Optional.
  A brief description is displayed on the site's banner.

- **quote**: Optional.
  A structure defining a quote and its author.
  This quote is from Yoda.

- **menu_pages**: Optional.
  An array of main navigation menu items.
  Each item has a `title` and a `url`.

- **footer_pages**: Optional.
  An array of pages that will appear in the site's footer.
  Each item has a `title` and a `url`.

- **social_links**: Optional.
  An array of social media links.
  Each link has a name, a boolean indicating if it's enabled, a URL, and an SVG icon.

---

## Front matter

For blog posts (Markdown files in folder `content/blog`), this theme uses a directory structure where each post has its own folder.
This way, I have all resources for a post in one place.
It can include images, videos, and other files.

Each post is associated with an image displayed on the blog's main page and on the post's detail page.
If you do not provide an image under `extra.image`, a default image is used instead.

- **date**: the date of the blog posts, e.g. `2020-06-11`.

- **title**: the title of the blog posts, e.g. `The Game of Fifteen`.
 
- **description**: the description of the blog posts. It is used as a summary on the blog's main page.
 
- **authors**: an optional array of all the post's authors, e.g. `["Thomas Weitzel"]`.
  You can leave it empty, but then the first author will show up as `Unknown` in the feed (`atom.xml`).

- **taxonomies**: only the optional `tags` taxonomy is used by this theme.
  I tend to list programming languages used in the post, e.g. `["rust", "javascript"]`.
  You can omit it, but then the post will not show up under `tags`. 

- **extra.math**: either `false` (default) or `true`.
  If set to `true`, the post will be rendered with KaTex support for displaying math formulas.
  If the entry is omitted or set to `false`, the post will not have KaTex support.

- **extra.diagram**: either `false` (default) or `true`.
  Controls loading of the necessary JavaScript to render the Mermaid diagram.
  If set to `true`, the post will be rendered with Mermaid support for displaying diagrams
  by using the `diagram()` shortcode.

- **extra.image**: an optional image for the post.
  If omitted, a default image is used instead.
  The image is displayed on the blog's main page and on the post's detail page.

---

## Localization

Consider this text on a page where a blog post is published as an example: `Published on July 04, 2023; 1,234 words`.
If your blog is in the German language, you want to have `Veröffentlicht am 04. Juli 2023; 1.234 Wörter` instead.
Not only the text should be translated, but also the date and number formats are different.
And you want a text like `1 word` or `1 Wort`, because the singular form should be used where applicable.
This theme takes care of that.

To localize your blog with this theme:

1. Pick your desired language by setting the `default_language` in `config.toml`.
   As of now, English (`en`) and German (`de`) have language resources available in the `i18n` directory.
   If your language is not supported yet, just create a new resource file with your translations.
   Use the file `en.toml` as a template for your own translations.
   Use the correct language code for the file name, e.g. `eo.toml` for Esperanto.
   This theme supports only languages that read from left-to-right (ltr).

2. The theme will automatically display all theme-specific string resources in the chosen language.

3. The content that you provide should match this language.
   But that is your responsibility.
   The theme will not translate your content.

If you need to define your own date format, look [here](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html) for supported specifiers.

---

## Integrating the theme folder

This project is structured as a stand-alone Zola site.
This section is for those who might want to integrate the theme into an existing Zola website.
You can do so by moving the relevant theme files to the `themes/zolarwind` directory.
All other files stay in the root directory.
If you have your own files there, you need to merge them with the ones from this theme.
You also need to adjust the `config.toml` and `package.json` files in the root accordingly.

I will only show you the relevant directories that need to be moved.
This is the directory structure of the stand-alone site, where the theme is in the root directory:

```
/
├── css
├── i18n
├── static
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   └── js
├── syntaxes
├── templates
└── theme.toml
```

Create a new directory `themes/zolarwind` and move the following files and directories there:

```
/
├── static
│   └── css
└── themes
    └── zolarwind
        ├── css
        ├── i18n
        ├── static
        │   ├── img
        │   └── js
        ├── syntaxes
        ├── templates
        └── theme.toml
```

The `static/css` directory is a special case.
It contains the generated Tailwind CSS file with the name `generated.css`.
It will stay in its original location.
This file is generated from the file `css/main.css`, which is the input for the CSS generation.
The generation process can be triggered with a script in the `package.json` file.
**You only need to adjust and run the script** in `package.json` if you make changes to the theme's template files or use new Tailwind CSS classes directly in your content files.
Since the source file `css/main.css` has moved to the directory `themes/zolarwind/css/main.css`, we need to adjust the script in `package.json` accordingly.

This is what the relevant part of it looks like for the stand-alone site:

```json
"scripts": {
  "css:build": "npx tailwindcss -i ./css/main.css -o ./static/css/generated.css --minify",
  "css:watch": "npx tailwindcss -i ./css/main.css -o ./static/css/generated.css --watch",
  "server": "zola serve"
}
```

Now change it so that the input file `css/main.css` will be the file `themes/zolarwind/css/main.css`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "css:build": "npx tailwindcss -i ./themes/zolarwind/css/main.css -o ./static/css/generated.css --minify",
  "css:watch": "npx tailwindcss -i ./themes/zolarwind/css/main.css -o ./static/css/generated.css --watch",
  "server": "zola serve"
}
```

Since you now use Zolarwind as a theme, you need to declare it in the `config.toml` file.
The theme's files have moved to the directory `themes/zolarwind`, so you need to adjust the only reference to the theme's files in the `config.toml` file accordingly by changing the `path_language_resources` entry:

```toml
# The site theme to use
theme = "zolarwind"

# ...

# Path to the language resource files
path_language_resources = "themes/zolarwind/i18n/"
```

---

## Development

If you want to adjust the CSS of the theme to your needs, you will need to edit the files in the `templates` and `css`
directories. While you do this, you should make sure that the CSS file `static/css/generated.css` is up to date. This
file is generated from the file `css/main.css`, and all the files that Tailwind automatically identifies via automatic
content detection.

If you ever need to explicitly add a source file excluded by default, you can always add it with the `@source`
directive, right in your `css/main.css` file:

```css
@source "../node_modules/@my-company/ui-lib";
```

So whenever one of these files changes, you need to run the script `css:build` from the `package.json` file.
To achieve this, you need to have `Node.js` and all dependencies from `package.json` installed (with `npm install`).
Then you can run the script with `npm run css:watch`.
It monitors all files mentioned above and triggers the CSS generation whenever a relevant file changes.
This ensures, that the file `static/css/generated.css` is always up to date.

I recommend having two terminals open.
In one terminal, run `npm run server` - or just `zola serve` - to start the Zola server.
In the other terminal, run `npm run css:watch` to start the CSS generation whenever a relevant file changes.

That way, your local web browser will automatically reload the page with the updated CSS whenever you change a file.

## Remarks

### Typography for Markdown

I'm not using `@tailwindcss/typography` for styling of Markdown files.
I don't like how it looks.
Instead, I use `@apply` in the `css/main.css` file.
The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS enables you to compose utility classes into custom CSS classes.
This makes it possible to apply multiple utility styles within a single class, making it efficient to style Markdown content.

This approach has pros and cons.
But it gives me fine-grained control over how the result looks like.
While it is time-consuming, I prefer this solution over the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin.
 
Yes, I'm reinventing the wheel here, because for common typographic patterns, I'm just recreating what's already provided by the typography plugin.

### Serve KaTex files locally

All KaTex files are included in the `static` directory for this theme.
Using KaTeX (or any other library) by serving it from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) has implications concerning the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the use of cookies:

- **Third-Party Requests & Data Privacy**: When you load resources from a CDN, it triggers third-party requests to the CDN's servers.
  These servers might log your IP address, user agent, and other request-related metadata.
  Under GDPR, IP addresses can be considered personal data.
  By serving KaTeX from your domain, you reduce third-party data transfers, limiting the amount of personal data you expose to external entities.

- **Cookies**: Many CDNs set cookies for various reasons, including analytics or performance optimizations.
  These cookies can track users across different websites that use the same CDN, potentially infringing on their privacy rights.
  By hosting KaTeX on your domain, you have full control over cookies and can ensure compliance with GDPR.

- **Consent**: If you're using a CDN that sets cookies or collects data, you might need to get explicit user consent before loading resources from that CDN.
  This can complicate user experience and lead to a reduced site performance for users who opt-out.
  By self-hosting, you circumvent this issue.

- **Transparency & Control**: By self-hosting, you know exactly which version of KaTeX you're using and can ensure there are no modifications or unexpected behaviors.
  With CDNs, there's a minor risk of the library being compromised, which could affect all sites using that resource.

- **Data Transfer Outside the EU**: If the CDN servers are located outside the European Union, you might be transferring data out of the EU,
  which adds another layer of GDPR compliance requirements.
  By self-hosting, you ensure that user data doesn't leave the region unless you specifically choose a hosting solution outside the EU.

# Zplit

Zplit is a single-page, centrally-divided layout designed for a professional online presence. It features a large image or video on the left, accompanied by content on the right. Zplit is a port of [Split](//onepagelove.com/split) by [One Page Love](//onepagelove.com) for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

![Zola Zplit Theme screenshot](screenshot.png)

**DEMO**: [https://zplit.netlify.app/](https://zplit.netlify.app/)

## Installation

Download the theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/gicrisf/zplit.git
```

Then, enable the theme editing your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "zplit"
```

## Getting started

The most important file of the theme is located in the root directory and is named =config.toml=. Edit this file to customize your preferences. Look for sections like `[extra]` to set variables like `author`, or `[extra.content]` to modify intro_tagline.

If something is unclear or not obvious, you might have missed [the "configuration" section of the Zola official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/). Even if you're new to static site generators, don't worry and take some time to go through the documentation, as it covers fundamental concepts.

Here after, we will discuss two specific sections in more detail, because those are unique for the Zplit theme:
- Background image
- Lists (of links)

### Background image

Edit the `[extra.visual]` section to set your background image of choice.

```toml
[extra.visual]

background = "<your-image-file-path-goes-here>"
```

You can find this example already written as the default:

```toml
[extra.visual]

background = "images/background.jpg"
position = "center center"
```

As you can see, you can edit the relative position of the image, which is centered by default.

### Lists

You can set up to 3 lists of links in the `[extra.lists]` section of the `config.toml` file: 
- connect
- social
- network

Manipulating them is very easy: just add/remove elements in the TOML list, as showed in this example (also already present in the default file):

``` toml
social = [
    {url = "https://t.me/zwitterio", text = "Telegram"},
    {url = "https://twitter.com/gicrisf", text = "Twitter"},
    {url = "https://github.com/gicrisf", text = "Github"},
]
```

Do you want another item? Just throw it up to the pile. You have no limits.
Remember to set the `url` field with the link itself you want to direct your user at and a `text` to show in the page for the corrisponding URL.

## Posts

To add new posts, simply place markdown files in the `content` directory. In order to sort the post index by date, you need to enable the `sort_by` option in the `content/_index.md` file within the index section.

```toml
sort_by = "date"
```


This theme was not specifically designed for blogging, but rather as a landing page for professionals. However, if you wish to blog using this theme, you certainly can. To do so, simply add a new section in the content directory and include it in the main menu through the config file. This will make it readily accessible to the user.

The theme does not offer support for taxonomies or other advanced features. It is focused on providing simple pages. If you wish to enhance the blogging functionality, you are welcome to customize the code or submit a specific request as an issue.

## Custom CSS

To make custom changes to the original stylesheets, you can create a `custom.css` file in the `static` directory. In this file, you can add any modifications or additions you desire.

## Custom colors

If you need to make adjustments to the colors or grid dimensions, it may be easier to modify the frontmatter of the `_01-content.scss` file directly. In this file, you will find variables conveniently located at the top:

``` scss
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Variables
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Colors
$color-background : #061C30;
$color-text       : #848d96;
$color-link       : #848d96;
$color-link-hover : #CA486d;
$color-maverick   : #47bec7;
$color-tagline    : #CCCCCC;

// Breakpoints
$bp-smallish      : 1200px;
$bp-tablet        : 800px;
$bp-mobile        : 500px;
```

# Zulma

A Bulma theme for Zola. See a live preview [here](https://festive-morse-47d46c.netlify.com/)

## Installation

First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/Worble/Zulma
```

and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "Zulma"
```

That's it! No more configuration should be required, however it might look a little basic. Head to the Options section to see what you can set for more customizability.

## Javascript

### Sources

All the source javascript files live in `javascript/src`. Following is a list of the javascript files, their purpose, and their sources. All files are prefixed with `zulma_` to avoid any name clashes.

- `zulma_search.js` - Used when a user types into the search box on the navbar (if enabled). Taken from [Zola's site](https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/6100a43/docs/static/search.js).
- `zulma_navbar.js` - Used for the mobile navbar toggle. Taken from the [bulma template](https://github.com/dansup/bulma-templates/blob/6263eb7/js/bulma.js) at Bulmaswatch
- `zulma_switchcss.js` - Used for swapping themes (if enabled).

### Building

The JavaScript files are transpiled by babel, minified by webpack, sourcemaps are generated and then everything placed in `static/js`. The repo already contains the transpiled and minified files along with their corrosponding sourcemaps so you don't need to do anything to use these. If you would prefer to build it yourself, feel free to inspect the js files and then run the build process (please ensure that you have [node, npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and optionally [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed):

```bash
cd javascript
yarn
yarn webpack
```

### Github warnings

You may get warnings about vulnerabilities from the JavaScript dependencies. These shouldn't be an issue since we only have dev-dependencies and none of the them reach the end-user, but if you don't want to run the buld process yourself, and to stop Github pestering you about security warnings, feel free to delete the top level `javascript` folder when committing.

## Options

### Pagination

Zulma makes no assumptions about your project. You can freely paginate your content folder or your taxonomies and it will adapt accordingly. For example, editing or creating section (`content/_index.md`) and setting pagination:

```toml
paginate_by = 5
```

This is handled internally, no input is needed from the user.

### Taxonomies

Zulma has 3 taxonomies already set internally: `tags`, `cateogories` and `authors`. Setting of any these three in your config.toml like so:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    {name = "categories"},
    {name = "tags", paginate_by = 5, rss = true},
    {name = "authors", rss = true},
]
```

and setting any of them in a content file:

```toml
[taxonomies]
categories = ["Hello world"]
tags = ["rust", "ssg", "other", "test"]
authors = ["Joe Bloggs"]
```

will cause that metadata to appear on the post, either on the header for the name, or at the bottom for tags and categories, and enable those pages.

Making your own taxonomies is also designed to be as easy as possible. First, add it to your cargo.toml

```toml
taxonomies = [
    {name = "links"},
]
```

and make the corrosponding folder in your templates, in this case: `templates\links`, and the necessary files: `templates\links\list.html` and `templates\links\single.html`

And then for each, just inherit the taxonomy master page for that page. Before rendering the content block, you may optionally set a variable called `title` for the hero to display on that page, otherwise it will use the default for that taxonomy.

In `single.html`:

```jinja
{%/* extends "Zulma/templates/taxonomy_single.html" */%}
```

In `list.html`:

```jinja
{%/* extends "Zulma/templates/taxonomy_list.html" */%}

{%/* block content */%}
{%/* set title = "These are all the Links"*/%}
{{/* super() */}}
{%/* endblock content */%}
```

### Menu Links

In extra, setting `zulma_menu` with a list of items will cause them to render to the top menu bar. It has two paramers, `url` and `name`. These _must_ be set. If you put \$BASE_URL in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual site URL. This is the easiest way to allow users to navigate to your taxonomies:

```toml
[extra]
zulma_menu = [
    {url = "$BASE_URL/categories", name = "Categories"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/tags", name = "Tags"},
    {url = "$BASE_URL/authors", name = "Authors"}
]
```

On mobile, a dropdown burger is rendered using javascript. If the page detects javascript is disabled on the clients machine, it will gracefully degrade to always showing the menu (which isn't pretty, but keeps the site functional).

### Brand

In extra, setting `zulma_brand` will cause a brand image to display in the upper left of the top menu bar. This link will always lead back to the homepage. It has two parameters, `image`(optional) and `text`(required). `image` will set the brand to an image at the location specified, and `text` will provide the alt text for this image. If you put \$BASE_URL in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual site URL. If `image` is not set, the brand will simply be the text specified.

```toml
[extra]
zulma_brand = {image = "$BASE_URL/images/bulma.png", text = "Home"}
```

### Search

Zulma provides search built in. So long as `build_search_index` is set to `true` in `config.toml` then a search input will appear on the top navigation bar. This requires javascript to be enabled to function; if the page detects javascript is disabled on the clients machine, it will hide itself.

The search is shamefully stolen from [Zola's site](https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/master/docs/static/search.js). Thanks, Vincent!

### Title

In extra, setting `zulma_title` will set a hero banner on the index page to appear with that title inside.

```toml
[extra]
zulma_title = "Blog"
```

If you want to get fancy with it, you can set an image behind using sass like so:

```scss
.index .hero-body {
  background-image: url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Plum_trees_Kitano_Tenmangu.jpg/1200px-Plum_trees_Kitano_Tenmangu.jpg);
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
  background-blend-mode: overlay;
}
```

This will set the image behind the hero, and darken it so the main text can still be easily read.

### Theming

In extra, setting `zulma_theme` to a valid value will change the current colour scheme to that one. All themes were taken from [Bulmaswatch](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/). Valid theme values are:

- default
- darkly
- flatly
- pulse
- simplex
- lux
- slate
- solar
- superhero

All valid themes can also be found under the `extra.zulma_themes` variable in the `theme.toml`. Choosing no theme will set default as the theme. Setting an invalid theme value will cause the site to render improperly.

```toml
[extra]
zulma_theme = "darkly"
```

Additionally, in extra, you can also set the `zulma_allow_theme_selection` boolean. Setting this to `true` will allow a menu in the footer to allow users to select their own theme. This option will store their theme choice in their localstorage and apply it on every page, assuming `zulma_allow_theme_selection` is still true. This requires javascript to be enabled to function; if the page detects javascript is disabled on the clients machine, it will hide itself.

Each theme contains the entirety of Bulma, and will weigh in at ~180kb. If you're running on a server severely limited on space, then I'd recommend you delete each theme you're not using, either from the source or from `/public`. Obviously, doing this will cause `zulma_allow_theme_selection` to work improperly, so make sure you either override `extra.zulma_themes` in `config.toml` to only show themes you have left or to not enable this option at all.

```toml
[extra]
zulma_allow_theme_selection = true
```

## Original

This template is based on the [blog template](https://bulmatemplates.github.io/bulma-templates/templates/blog.html) over at [Free Bulma Templates](https://bulmatemplates.github.io/bulma-templates/). All themes were taken from [Bulmaswatch](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/). The code behind from originally adapted from the [after-dark](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark/blob/master/README.md) zola template.

## Known Bugs

- If user theme swapping is enabled and the user selects a theme different to the default, a slight delay will be introduced in page rendering as the css gets swapped out and in by the javascript. This is particularly pronounced when using the dark theme, since it will flash white before going back to black. This is better than the alternative flashes of unstyled content or old theme, but still annoying. I don't know any way around this, but with browser caching it should be fast enough to not cause serious issues.

                                Zola comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of contents
                                and many other features that traditionally require setting up a dev environment
                                or adding some JavaScript libraries to your site.

                                The average site will be generated in less than a second,
                                including Sass compilation and syntax highlighting.

                                Zola renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to handle
                                any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no cost without having
                                to worry about managing a server or a database.

                                From the CLI to the template engine, everything is designed to be intuitive.
                                Don't take my word for it though, look at the
                                <a href="{{ get_url(path='@/documentation/_index.md') }}">documentation</a> and see for yourself.

                                Zola gets out of your way so you can focus on your content, be it a blog,
                                a knowledge base, a landing page or a combination of them.
